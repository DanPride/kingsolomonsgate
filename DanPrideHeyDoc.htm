		An ad for Pride's company which ran on the Back Cover of "Hospitals
		and Health Networks" hangs over the Juke box in the "Bank Bar",
		Saratoga Ca, ...Dettling's Regular Bar. The Sunset photo was taken by
		Bar owner Jim Sullivan. He hung it in the most prominent spot in the
		bar the <U>same day</U> the Nathan R note was delivered to the New
		York Times in New York. The Magazines publication date of June 20,
		1993 is also <B>coincidentally</B> the <U>same day</U> the Nathan R
		letter was mailed. The&nbsp; note was mailed in a postal box late at
		night and postmarked the next morning <A

		June 21, 1993. <SMALL>(See below)</SMALL><BR>The ad's headline

		The Ad was designed by Jim Hurdle of New York. Formerly my boss at RCA
		records. An advertisers copy of the Magazine was delivered about a
		week early which I gave to Jim Sullivan as a "Thanks" for the free use
		of his African Sunset photo. He had it framed and hung it over the
		Juke box days later. <BR>
