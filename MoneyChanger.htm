	<p align=center>The Money Changers Revenge</p>
	<br>
	<P class=story align=center>He looked small, thin and scruffy.
		Rather a pathetic figure I thought as I approached him in the
		courtyard of the mosque to exchange my money for Turkish Lire. He was
		one of several Money Changers standing there doing their trade. I had
		been told this was the best rate in town.</P>
	<P class=story align=center>I asked him how much and he glared at
		me, tossed his head back and quoted an outrageous exchange rate. A
		little startled, I smiled dismissively and said something sarcastic to
		him. He wheeled on his heel and closed the few feet between us
		menacingly. As he approached he held his hand high and I reacted to
		the threat by holding my right hand up to catch the blow which I
		anticipated. My fingers spread (in retrospect) like a baseball mitt.
		Instead, I felt his fingers probe my hand, as he transfixed me with a
		ferocious eyeball to eyeball stare,... and then grabbing my ring
		finger alone in his fist he swung his hand down. As our hands passed
		in front of my crotch I heard and felt the crack crack crack of my
		knuckle as it shattered. I pulled back with a yelp and extracted my
		finger from his grasp. As I held my hand in front of me the outer
		fingers dangled uselessly, my hand had been broken in half. Beyond the
		site of my broken hand, as I withdrew, he was steadily approaching me.
		A car came into view on the right as I backed into the street. I ran
		in front of the car and put the traffic between him and me and made my
		escape back to the pension.</P>

		In the spring of 1977 the building was the Ayasofya museum, before
		that it was a mosque, but when it was built by the Roman Emperor
		Justinian in 537 A.D. (creator of the Justinian Code of Justice) it
		was the Hagia Sofia church. On its opening day, in its dedication on
		the same spot, Justinian exclaimed <b>"Solomon I have outdone
			thee!"</b>. It was the greatest church in Christendom until St Peter's
		Basilica was built in Rome a thousand years later.

	</p>
	<P class=bible align=center>
		<B>In the <U>Temple courts</U> he found men selling cattle,<BR>sheep
			and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So<BR>he
			made a whip out of cords and drove all from the Temple, both<BR>sheep
			and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers<BR>and
			overturned their tables. (John 2:13-16)

		As if getting your hand broken dealing with a Money Changer in the
		courtyard of Justinian's church, on the spot where Justinian
		proclaimed <i>"Solomon I have outdone thee",</i> isn't enough of a
		link to King <i>Solomon's</i> Gate, like almost all these events there
		is more. As in all Gate related events,... the deeper you look the
		stranger it gets. Altho it has been now 33 years, it is hard to forget
		the face of a man staring eyeball to eyeball, inches from your face as
		he breaks your hand in half (the image is indelible). The man who
		broke my hand in half was Mehmet Ali Agca. Two years later Agca shot
		Pope John Paul in St Peters Square. Agca was at the
		time of my attack active with the "Grey Wolves" group in
		Istanbul. My attack was one of a series of documented attacks on
		tourists in Istanbul organized and conducted by the Grey Wolves. The
		attacks were primarily in response to the international hippie cafe
		the "<a href=PuddingShop.htm>Pudding Shop</a>" a common stop for
		travelers en route to India from Europe at the time, and my favorite
		hangout. The man who directed me to the Mosque was standing in front
		of the the pudding shop diagonally across the street from the
		Ayasofya. Interestingly, <a href="MoneyC_AgcaAlone.pdf">Agca's
			Bulgarian Connection</a> was a plant by the CIA apparently. The minuet comes full
		circle (as many of them do) with my subsequent appearance on every
		single Television channel world wide at the election of John Paul's
		successor Benedict 16th at the Vatican, driven there by a dream that
		would not stop, standing on the very spot where Agca shot John Paul, with the events
		quite accurately described by the revelations ten passage I was reading at
		the time. (See: <a href="index.html#Life">Habemus Papam</a>, the
		video's end is a punctuation point on a incredulous chain of events and logic. And now, out comes this from faux
		Money Changer's mouth ...whilst holding up his right
			hand no less, a pose he repeats time and again in news photos. I am probably the only person on this planet that
		accepts his statement at this point. As the planet begins a 50 gigaton methane explusion, 
		his statement now jives with the consensus opinion of leading scientists from Cambridge to Harvard. 
		They phrase it as an <a href="http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/">18 degree temperature rise by 2026</a>, but its the same thing.
		 In my experience divine actors and actions include all kinds.
