		<i><b>The Boston Welfare Motel Scandal</b></i>
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">It was difficult to judge their
		reactions to what I was showing them. They seemed to be interested in
		all the wrong things. I at least hoped we had put the scandal thing to
		rest. The Computerized Tenant Housing selection system had hit the
		Boston ghetto housing market like a storm, and as it began to dominate
		low income housing in Roxbury and Dorchester in the late 80's. Tenants
		who didn't get housing now had a target or so it seemed.</p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">
		<a href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/Boston_Phoneix_Article.htm">
			<img border-color="blue" src="images/Phoenix_article.gif"
			align="left" border="2" height="625" hspace="10" width="302">
		</a> Alison and I had decided to have officials from the Boston Housing
		Authority and the Metropolitan Housing Authority over to my Coolidge
		Corner Brookline office for a catered lunch and demo to show them
		exactly what we were doing and how.
	</p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">We were computer selecting tenants
		by a computerized score point system, not as ghetto slander had it
		"doing strange things at night". For months we had been computer
		generating letters to new landlords in Roxbury and Dorchester
		promoting ourselves to the landlords and trying to convince them that
		our computer selection system would get them only the best tenants. I
		had written a computer program that grabbed housing sales records for
		the city and mail merged a mass mailer to them. We told the new
		landlord about our "database confirmed landlord research, Employment
		and community confirmed references, work history... etc etc etc. We
		Could get you a REALLY good tenant and save you from Damaging and
		Criminal tenants.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">We mailed many of those thousands
		of computer generated letters directly to the house address. Many of
		those letters were opened by those very Damaging and Criminal tenants.
		Maybe they beat up the last landlord, got arrested whatever... they
		all either read or heard about the letter addressed to the
		landlord,... "and so and so's Landlord got one too I heard"...</p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">On top of that,... people would
		call and get entered into the database, get a confirmation letter
		describing accurately what they told us and how we worked. The next
		time they called we would say "we already have you". Because every
		worker, shelter, everybody in the industry,... had our number and gave
		it out, Confused people in difficult circumstances would bounce
		through the system in Boston and everybody just gave them our phone
		number. They would call six to a dozen times over a year or so...
		always get yep, you lived here and did this and we got ya and we are
		doing our best, all to the click of a data entry keyboard audible in
		the background.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">Thus started the explosive rumor
		that "Pride Realty knew everything". In a community where many had
		much too hide,... those with much to hide were primarily the one's
		opening the letters addressed to the landlord. Perhaps a piece of
		leverage they could use? Nope,... bad news in the form of Pride
		Realty.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">We asked a 72 question
		questionnaire over the phone and data entered the answers. I wrote the
		program and the stunningly beautiful Alison Hammond handled the phones
		and tenant communication. I ran the business and Alison ran the tenant
		database which I designed. We recorded everything, computer tracked
		the inspections process, who lived where, what they paid ,... who the
		landlord was,... who were the welfare officials assigned. The
		references all spun to the same file so we started calling landlords
		and getting ten references at once to save time. By the third "and
		Darlene Smith at 32 Dorchester Ave. from jan to may of 78... how was
		she?", they just dumped all their listings on us. This was 1987 and
		that sort of thing was unheard of at the time.</p>

	<p class="intro" align="center">We tracked all the housing
		advocates and shelters and computer generated letters of the
		apartments we were offering, the list was exploding in volume and we
		were sending it to the very people who had jobs with the state to find
		housing for poor tenants.</p>
	<p class="intro" align="center">We got em all (as in ALL of the
		available apartments).... hardy har har har !</p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">
		We assigned a score to each reference and Summed and Averaged the
		scores. Eligible references were Landlords, Employers, Clergy. Any
		participation in the Community from any perspective got you points.
		The profile is what the system produced and that corresponded with
		happy landlords. Tenants they were getting paid a premium for as
		difficult, were not. Low damage, good relations, HIGH PROFIT.
		Landlords like Kevin Ryan, Jane Miller, Collins and others made
		millions (14 of them I believe) and bought and rehabbed more
		properties as the income stream rapidly grew. <i>This
			Wealth/Prosperity effect in surrounding participants is widespread in
			many of these events, not just this one, but often unreferenced.</i>
		Unfortunately it does not seem to rub off that well :(
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The Ghetto gripped by a crippling
		housing shortage erupted in an emotional frenzy on all sides. Housing
		was being realigned to tenant performance. Our typical tenant profile
		was single mother of three, GED, part time at an insurance company for
		several years, limited but good credit, Church-member...</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">We were sending those ever
		expanding lists of available apartments out to the angry and out of
		business housing "advocates" because we were creating a viable low
		income property industry... generating housing. We totally Dominated
		the market to be sure, by the end we had 80 percent of the market. But
		it was a market we were creating. It was time to be recognized, even
		if it did cost us our weeks profits for the caterer.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">But as we put the system through
		its paces for them. X of the Boston Housing Authority and Y of the
		Metropolitan Housing Authority (later went to jail I believe) were
		polite but distant. They got intensely interested as I demonstrated
		the Data Entry and reporting and analysis capability. What information
		we were capturing interested them, but they did not seem to care about
		the fact that most of our units were with repeat landlords coming in
		with new rehabs, more of them all the time.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		<a href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/HomelessHousing_1.htm"> <img
			src="images/WelfareScandalTmb.gif" align="right" border="1"
			height="744" hspace="10" width="493"></a>
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">We did not know it, but as we sat
		there demonstrating what a social benefit we were, our guests were
		looking to see how much we knew and were discovering that we did
		indeed know everything, even if we didn't know we knew...</p>
	<p class="intro" align="center">
		<i>"He hasn't figured it out yet...but..."</i>
	</p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">We argued that we were realigning
		the influence of property in the ghetto away from drugs, violence, and
		problems,... and instead were directly rewarding community
		involvement. Kids on Honor Roll got the family points,... and in
		several cases tipped the balance for several families.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">But they were watching the
		financial records we were generating outside the government mainframe.
		They knew before we did that with the data we had,... worker, hotel,
		price, week. We had the goods on them even if we didn't know we had
		the goods on them. Disaster for them was a simple computer sort by us
		on the "welfare worker", "Motel", "Price" and "Family size"... away.</p>
	<p class="bible" align="center">Who got what when and for whom.
		Mafia Motels and Welfare worker kickbacks and special pricing's eating
		a third of homeless emergency funds for the Boston Area.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The resistance suddenly got fierce
		after that meeting. Harder inspections, more scandal rumors that were
		absurd, all sorts of things. We were trading sex for apartments was
		the standard ghetto cry against landlord oppression. We printed out
		our entire placement list, all 200 families and got an interview with
		the premiere investigative Newspaper in Boston journalism. The writer
		chose to ignore my nightly clubbing at a heavy metal joint and acquit
		me of strange things at night, strangely, placing heavy metal as
		innocence by parallel :) and irrelevant.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		The result was a full page <a
			href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/Boston_Phoneix_Article.htm">Boston
			Phoenix feature article</a>,... complimentary but it made me sound a
		little more hippy idealist intellectual than I liked. We had housed
		200 families for five years each, we were having an impact. We had
		literally generated 1000 years of stable housed family life for
		families who would not have had it but for our efforts. Enough was
		enough. The staffs at the housing authorities had figured it out after
		several years of "Praise Jesus" tenants streaming through to sign
		leases, what was the politicos problem?
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		The Low income housing industry, the tenant advocates, the pols, the
		community leaders, the churches were all impacted. Ministers suddenly,
		almost invariably, saw the regulars in their congregation get housing,
		often with a choice of two or three units. Tenants with a lot of
		trouble in their background and nothing going on were just plain
		stopped cold. Toward the end the phone was ringing with...<br>
		<br>
		<i> "You gonna get ma mama an partment o i'm gonna come up dere n'
			kick yo ass....</i>
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The entire industry exploded in
		frenzy. Landlords building, housing advocates slandering, the ghetto
		exploding in emotional anguished outbursts. Dukakis had just been
		defeated and the only thing North East democrats had left was the
		homeless issue as the christmas televised fund drive for the homeless
		came up that year, only five short weeks after the Dukakis defeat to
		George Bush. The advocates had decided to finish off Pride Realty in a
		scream of McCarthy style accusations on the Air Live, and get back to
		the business of finding houses for their friends.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">It had been obvious for weeks
		something was up. Advocates (not staff) we had talked to for several
		years now but never met face to face sounded different. The system
		warmed up on some small time Landlord who had had sex with a tenant. I
		don't know how the man survived the press assault, it was brutal. It
		was a warning. The Mainstream News took its lead from the Housing
		Authorities and the Housing Advocates and was sharpening its knives to
		remove the cancer when the Boston Phoenix feature article appeared and
		forever altered the situation.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		I had at the time, decided to send out a Christmas Newsletter to these
		same said people. It talked about the <b>irrational pricing system</b>
		and how much <b>better deals could be cut for the homeless</b>. "Why
		we could buy a building and equip every unit with advanced computer
		training tied to an immediate rewards system based on training
		performance with this much money"... I sent it innocently and without
		guile to everybody at the same time, where many but not all were a
		part of it, but all knew about it.
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The entire community exploded in a
		frenzy of whispers. It got all the way to the State House from where a
		voice transmitted that I had better shut up quick or be shut up.
		Veiled threats in columns from the likes of Presidential Historian
		Doris Kearns Goodwin, to one on the editorial page of the Boston
		Globe, appeared. Close friends and ally's like the head of the Boston
		NAACP chapter called with worried concern.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">And then came the night of the
		Christmas Homeless Telethon. I watched it from my Beacon Street
		apartment and could hear my name carried by acrimonious voices arguing
		in the background. The housing advocates ambush had been
		short-circuited by the research of the premier journalistic source in
		Bean town. The advocates backed by the Officials were ready to filet
		me in public and were arguing for the coup de grace in the background
		as the show droned on in a collective political scream "What about the
		Homeless".</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The Press, caught between the
		advocates and officialdom on one side and their own journalistic
		leadership on the other was confused,... and paused. Nothing else
		happened the night of the Boston Christmas Homeless Telethon of 1989,
		or over the next few days, which gave me the time I needed.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">As I puzzled over the situation
		during the days that followed, one memorable call came from a priest
		we had done a placement for some months earlier. Father John Geoghan,
		the man who would shortly start the priest molestation scandal, called
		and counseled about strength when facing such baseless accusations as
		were regrettably so common in the ghetto.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">The situation was really disturbing
		to me to say the least. Why the resistance from the officials who had
		seen the system? seen its results, knew what was going on? I sat late
		one evening at the computer in my office puzzling over the situation.
		It just did not make sense. Then I did the sort. The exact list of
		everyone involved in overpriced payments, and the critics, floated
		right to the top. Bonfire of the Vanities all over again.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">I called the press and after a long
		conversation hit the print button, printed out eight large boxes of
		records, our entire database and sent it by courier to the Boston
		Herald on their tab,... the republican newspaper in Boston.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">Then I sat back to wait on events
		and see what would happen next. A week later the Housing Authority
		emergency cancelled all outstanding certificates without a signed
		lease. The Housing Authority had for years been forced to return a
		large portion of it's federal budget allocation for low income
		vouchers. We had expanded their placements to the point now where they
		were oversubscribed.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">Then nothing. With no leases being
		signed we were out of business, it was over, but the pot was boiling
		on high.</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		The phone rang occasionally with anonymous threats of people who still
		thought somehow we could get them an apartment if they scared us
		enough. We were more scared when we figured out who owned the various
		Motels involved. All sorts of rumors of investigations swirled around.
		Then the story broke like a storm and the Mafia was out six million a
		year thanks to us. Our luncheon guests were on their way to jail. I
		hid in my apartment with an axe for weeks as public investigations and
		recriminations dragged on. Right in the middle of it,, when tension
		was at its highest, Eileen Green, a familiar name from the <b>Solomon</b>
		Carter Fuller Mental Health center was murdered, <a
			href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/HomeGreen.htm">beheaded ala
			John the Baptist....</a> and then Finally a very nice letter was
		delivered from His Honor, the honorable Mayor Raymond Flynn. He
		thanked me for my public service and all I had gone through and for
		what I had contributed.
	</p>

	<p class="bible" align="center">
		I felt like I had been properly and honorably discharged. Besides,
		there were people who worried me a whole lot more than the Mayor at
		this point. I financed a car, with the assistance and creative application editing of friend
		Greg Hummel, loaded it with goods, told everybody I was moving to
		Washington DC and then left for New York to join my loyal friend
		Alison and start a computer consulting career with my newly learned
		database skills. Greg apparently later became a multimillion dollar
		landlord (not yet confirmed), which would make him the 15th
		millionaire for just this one event. Thereafter Greg was also one of many 
		questioned in the <a
			href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8394393.html">murder of
			Swedish nanny Karina Holmer</a>  and subsequently released. The
		Holmer murder was also by dismemberment and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2finkb/karina_holmer_swedish_nanny_severed_body_found_in/">beheading</a>...
	</p>

	<p class="intro" align="center">
		I did not start out to find 200 homeless families housing, become the
		personal target of scandal, expose a multi-million dollar theft of
		funds intended for the poor, get <a
			href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/HomeGreen.htm">Eileen Green
			of the <b>Solomon</b> Carter Fuller Center murdered
		</a> (beheaded Ala John the Baptist), become the hero of Roxbury churches
		and get insulted by an ill informed JFK Jr whilst being virtually
		"Banned in Boston" for a time. It just sort of worked out that way.<br>

	<p class="intro" align="center">
		When they say Whitey Ran Southie they are not kidding. He really ran
		everything. In 1988 Southie was up in arms over the forced integration
		of the Whites and the Blacks in South Boston Public Housing. <img
			border-color="blue" src="images/whitey.jpg" align="right" border="2"
			hspace="15" vspace="10" /></a>At the time I ran a computerized housing placement
		service for Section 8 housing. I had the great idea that I might have
		a solution for them. My service searched for the very best tenants
		with certificates or vouchers. Southie already had a few black
		families who were accepted as "Good People". I figured I could sell
		them on it as a better solution than what was about to be forced down
		their throats. I was already placing about 80 percent of the Section 8
		in Dorchester and Roxbury and the landlords loved it. I asked and got
		a meeting with the tenant board. I met with about a dozen of the
		members in a Room in Southie and made my pitch. Many had already heard
		of my service. Almost all were nodding in agreement as I presented my
		solution as the best of a set of bad alternatives. It would avoid
		violence, and give them more "good blacks" like they already had. As
		the meeting progressed I knew I had it in the bag, they were nodding
		at every point and really getting very positive during the
		conversations. After about a half an hour, the woman who was head of
		it said "Well....? and looked over at this figure sitting back against
		the wall whom I had not even noticed. He gently shook his head back
		and forth,... her eyes fell, she sighed, looked at me and thanked me
		for spending the time. The figure in the chair leaning against the
		back wall was already on his way out the door and everybody else just
		stood up to leave. Several shook my hand and thanked me for the
		effort. I was floored, and started to stutter. I looked at the now
		empty chair and muttered "who the hell was that"? it was Whitey Bulger
