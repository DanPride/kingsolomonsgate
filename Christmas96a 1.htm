		*Jan 20 2004 web rumors indicate DNA ruled out Phil McReynolds as a
		suspect in JonBenet's murder, leaving the significance of this event
		in limbo. The individual I asked for a cigarette light that night was
		35 to 50 years old, emaciated, pot bellied, thin, about 5'11 and
		really terrified of something, perhaps just a schizophrenic having a
		bad day, perhaps someone who did not want to be seen. His physique
		reminded me of my father's after years of congestive heart failure.
		Vaguely cow boyish, He looked sort of like McReynolds from a two
		second flashed TV photo I saw years later after he died. After the
		encounter while waiting for the bus, the skitz boarded it also. The
		jacket had a ruddy stain about two inches wide and five vertical
		center chest left, the heart area. He sat one quarter the way back on
		the midnight Denver greyhound bus from Boulder that night on the right
		hand side. The individual constantly looked back over his shoulder at
		me (sitting half way back on the left) giving me the evil eye
		repeatedly and making me <u>very</u> <u>uncomfortable</u> until he got
		off at the second stop.&nbsp; (the highway intersection, I think?).
		James "Mac" Read, a fellow software (4D) developer at US West, had put
		me on the 6 o'clock bus from Longmont, It missed the connection, I
		went for coffee and missed the 7/8 and the 9/10 bus never showed that
		night leaving me with an unlit cigarette in the boulder station around
		midnight. Weird. An <A href="index.html">odd time for ME</A> to be
		stuck in the Boulder Bus Station...minutes after JonBenet Ramsey's <I><U>Christmas
