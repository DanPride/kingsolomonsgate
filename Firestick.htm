		The NYPD Regular Bar<br>8th Ave and 33th/34th st NYC<br>1990
	</H1>
	<br>
	<p class=story align=center>I had become a regular at the same bar
		where the Mid Town NYPD drank. It was across the street from the YMCA
		where I periodically stayed in the early days of living in the city as
		I got established, and it had a pool table with good players. I began
		stopping by regularly after getting "wilded" walking down 8th Ave from
		Central Park*. Smelling the Daisy's one evening after chatting up a
		really interesting woman over Diner at 59th street pub, I was walking
		on clouds oblivious to everything when six punks came out of nowhere.
		Bang one to the Jaw and I went down, then I got kicked once or twice
		before they were run off by a couple of really astute officers who
		were following them around town so as to be there to intercede. After
		that I always bought a drink when I ran into an NYPD, and have said
		"Sir" ever since. They had saved my bacon big time.</p>
	<p class=story align=center>I had gotten friendly with a midtown
		detective who was almost as good a pool player as I was, and we began
		swapping stories. I think he enjoyed a civilian who could actually
		match him story for story, and when I threw in Cambodia, occasionally
		best him. Still his stories of coming on shift and "taking back the
		street" in the area directly surrounding the Garden gave me a run for
		my money. Especially when, during a return visit to the bar on a NY
		stopover, I ran into him and he began to talk about the investigation
		of that horrible arson incident in the Subway. He described the device
		in detail, and the horrible injuries it had caused. He was dumbfounded
		by the combination of high tech and cruelty. I think that aspect of it
		really shook him. "Why in God's name would someone do something like
		that" he said to me.</p>
	<p class=story align=center>
		It took me a while to put the pieces together, but later I returned to
		the Bar with the <b>Photo</b> of Dettling holding the bat. My friend
		was not there that day, but soon every Cop in the Place went
		ballistic. I could feel thirty pairs of eyes through the back of my
		shirt. I had cops scrambling to follow me, when a little drunk and
		with a "hell with it" attitude I slipped outside for a joint with
		three obvious tails keeping an eye on me. They had all also heard the
		story, and they called their supervisors... I set a book of Photos on
		the bar and the off-duty bartender snapped it away and let me know in
		no uncertain terms I wasn't getting it back... I smiled and said "No
		problem that's your copy, that's why I came here". Their supervisor,
		or commissioner or some such, arrived on the scene, called due to the
		photo, looked carefully at the book and then with real respect,
		politely asked if he could keep it. Later I looked at the bartender
		and said "Did I get it where it needed to go" and he said "Yes". I
		think he comped me a whiskey at that point.
	</p>
	<p class=story align=center>
		Understand the sequence. I befriend the Detective in 1990. The photo
		is snapped with Dettling two years later, but I don't have any idea
		what it is about in 1992 ("Burn Baby Burn"). The attack hasn't
		happened yet. My friend then later tells me the story near the time of
		the actual attack two years later around 1994/5. Back on the east
		Coast again, five years after that I get the photo from Michael Hren
		(before he disappeared) then realize it matches <a
			href="FirestickSubway.htm#BombParts">my friends story</a>. Later
		still, I take it back to the bar where an involved detective goes
		ballistic at the first look of the hand carved wooden bat and gauze
		and "the crowd, or bar, goes wild :) )". In the subway attack the
		gauze was soaked in one chemical, then submerged in a bucket full of
		another chemical, when the bat is then removed and hits the air, it
		explodes in a spitting burning metal fireball... My friend had told me
		the kid had been permanently paralyzed by the attack.
	</p>
	<p class=story align=center>It doesn't seem to make sense. It
		strains credibility past the breakpoint. Its beyond the outer limits.
		But if you doubt my version, go the bar and get your own, it will
		match.</p>
	<p class=story align=center>
		...the bar was located in the <a href="images/Wilding.jpg">middle
			of the block</a> between 33 and 34, a block of two story buildings. A
		greek breakfast joint sat on the corner of 34, a shiny metal diner on
		the corner of 33, a parking lot after the diner and the ten story YMCA
		was directly across 8th Avenue (9th Avenue?). Anyone hurriedly
		investigating events due to the Ramsey issue should have no problem
		finding it, and no problem finding someone there, I suspect, who would
		recall it well. It was at the time of and tangentially related to
		flight 900. The story of the FC Pin left me seriously considering the
		features of the 900 incident. There is too much more to tell to get it
		done quickly, just trying to flush a few extras for the recently
		curious :)
	<p class=story align=center>* I suspect but can not really know
		that they were the ones later charged in the Central Park case, they
		were obviously well known to NYPD and would have been immediate
		suspects.</p>

		Photo, few Documentary sources exist for this story at the present

		suspicion, it occurred near the time of the Central Park Jogger. With
		Gate events you eventually learn to look under every Rock :)
