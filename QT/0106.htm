Allegheny Hall memory aid for Bob Clark</p>
<p align="center">
Bob - Look at the Diagram below for a minute then read this. I think you will 
find this interesting.</p>
<p align="center">
Imagine you are walking toward Allegheny hall. You walk down the road with no 
sidewalk, a few muddy ruts, a puddle here and there. You turn left walking 
across the black asphalt walkway up to the cement slab of the entranceway. Two 
white columns and a triangular structure or portico of a classical design is 
over your head as you enter. You 
grunt and pull open the heavy white doors with the little pains of glass in the 
top half. The inside of the door has that copper colored heavy push for emergency bar 
that looks like its been tacked on as an afterthought.. You walk 
across the 
heavy rubber mats on the floor. The wooden railing of the stairs goes off up to 
your right with that metal triangle pyramid deal on the top of the post. Worn 
metal showing through its green brown colors. Its the deal you always grab for 
when you are on the stairs in a hurry. </p>

Anyway, you walk up to the two swinging doors with the little 10 inch windows 
with the little diamond squares formed by the wires in the glass and look into the TV room is see if Dan and Lyde are 
watching TV. But you see just the heavy minister 
guy who always listens to &quot;Will the circle be unbroken&quot; and lives upstairs next 
to the heads sitting with Carol. You reach down and grab the handle. A big ten inch 
affair of metal, where you grab it with your fist in the center its a good 3 
inches off that brown door.&nbsp; You swing the doors back with a pull and walk into the lobby. 
(Try hearing the door swing close) The coke machine on 
your right, the TV on your left, next to the Candy machine you always gotta bang 
on. You slump down on those old squeaky leather 
couches with the hard wooden arm rests. Shapely curved wooden arms, but hard. You prop your head on the hard wooden 
armrest as best you can cause of the shortness of the couch and start to dream....but never in your wildest dreams ...:)

You then awake from your nap and you are going to go to the head to sit down on 
one of the three stools all right next to each other, so you can talk philosophy 
whilst the other guy grunts :) But as you leave the lounge you have to go 
through a set of swinging doors again. On one side of the swinging doors is a 
handle. On the other side is a dark copper colored metal rectangle about three 
inches wide and a foot high. </p>
<p align="center">
As you leave the lobby do you push on the metal plate or do you grab the handle 
and pull?</p>
<p align="center">
You finally get up to 201, knock and I'm in. You come in and sit in the chair 
opposite the door next to the bare wood boards bookshelf. You lean back and put your leg over the 
arm of the chair and we talk. You light up a cigarette and start to ask me for 
an ashtray as I sit on the bed half paying attention doing a roll. As I finish 
and look up you are tapping your cigarette on the edge of the pottery saucer you 
just picked off the shelf. I go ballistic at you screaming that that's Solomon's 
lamp... what the hell are you doing ....put that down. You adopt a superior attitude, 
say yea yea yea. Your favorite band is playing on the record player (Nicks). Yes, Bob, 
you did. Remember now ? In 1972 your tried to use King Solomon's Lamp as an 
ashtray, and poo pooed me when I freaked :)</p>
