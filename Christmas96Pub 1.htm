		Going Public Letter to the District Attorneys office<br> August
		22, 2006
	</H1>
	<P class=Intro align=center>
		Date: Tue, 22 Aug 2006 11:58:24 -0700 (PDT)<br> From: "Dan Pride"
		<@yahoo.com><br> Subject: <b>Going to Press re: 12:30
			Greyhound</b><br> To: boulder.da@co.boulder.co.us<br> There
		were at least twelve people sitting on that bus<br> between me
		and him. At least one WILL remember.<br> If you wish me not to,
		then respond now<br> Dan Pride<br>
	</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>After listenting to 4 Days of Karr was
		not in Boulder I sent this letter then went public the next day. I was
		being ignored again and that ticked me off. A simple we got your
		letter would have resulted in no Rocky Mountain News Article. In
		retrospect I may have been a little hasty. This team seems to know
		what they are doing. But by the time I knew that events were already
		underway. This one was not going to get away. Not again. Not this one.</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>Prior to this time there was no strong
		reason to come forward in a forceful manner and serious ones against
		such an action. I could not have come up with a sketch worth anything,
		and without a suspect, I was left with "something strange in the
		station". Yet I still can not avoid some small measure of
		responsibility for the torture of the Ramsey's. That is a regret, and
		for that I apologize. But who in their right mind could have predicted
		such an absurd lack of Judgment in the original investigative team.</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>
		It is interesting to watch the spectacle of spite that now pervades
		this story. Many commentators are waking up from the dream of a
		successful career to the nightmare realization of what they have done
		to a grieving mother and father. The answer is not to attack attack
		attack. You stew in your own juices when you do that. It shortens your
		life and reduces its quality. Take a page and understand one of the
		basic tenants of christianity, confess your sins, make your apologies.
		Honestly face what you have done and ask John Ramsey for forgiveness.
		I have and do. <br>
