		In Memory<BR>
	</H1>
	<p>
		From 1961 until the Communist takeover of Laos, our friend Jerry
		Daniels, dedicated his every ounce of energy towards helping the
		Hmong, the free people of Laos, improve the quality of our lives.
		Jerry gladly accepted life in our rural villages in order to better
		understand our problems, aspirations and dreams. Jerry shared with us
		the dream that one day life would return to normal and the Hmong
		people would be able to once again enjoy the beauty and serenity of
		the high mountains of Laos.<BR>
	</p>
	<p>
		Sadly, the dream was not to be. In 1975, the anti-Communist government
		of Laos fell to the invaders and the Hmong people along with our
		American friend had to flee for our lives to seek refuge in Thailand.<BR>
		<BR>Jerry continued to serve the people he loved as a State
		Department official at the American Embassy in Bangkok. Jerry saw to
		it that the Hmong were given the opportunity to come to the U.S. to
		begin a new life. We have the courage to meet the challenges which we
		must face because our friend Jerry taught us well. Jerry was not only
		our mentor, but our friend as well. He dedicated more than twenty
		years of his life to us and we grew to know him well. Not only in
		name, but in spirit too. I guess we love Jerry so much because we
		always knew that he honestly cared.<BR>
	</p>
	<p>
		Jerry's life came to a premature end in Bangkok, still serving the
		people he had grown to love. We all owe Jerry a lot and will miss him
		very much. Each of us in our own way will wish our friend a sad
		farewell. <BR>
	</p>
	<p>So until we meet again- Goodbye old friend.</p>

			<FONT color=#0000FF size=3><B>I believe the future life
