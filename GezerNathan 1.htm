		About the Nathan R note<BR>
	</H2>
	<P class=intro>
		The Nathan R note is at the center of the number one FBI Conspiracy on
		the world-wide-web (out of 400,000 sites) and has been for each of the
		last four years (2000-2003). If I, the former excavator of King
		Solomon's Gate, wrote the Nathan R note as claimed, then the truth of
		the largest, longest terrorist case in history is far different than
		has been reported with startling implications for the history of our
		time. The Unabom case becomes the first of the bogus terrorist cases
		in support of ever larger intelligence budgets. It <B>is</B> the start
		of the path that leads to 9/11 and the Iraq war. The Nathan R note and
		the case as well as the name Nathan also seem to be surrounded, indeed
		enveloped in a series of incredible personal coincidences, nearly all
		independently verifiable, but at the same time tremendously odd.
	</P>
	<P class=intro>&nbsp;</P>
	<P class=intro>
		The FBI claims they do not know the notes author. They have also
		repeatedly refused an interview despite passing <U>polygraphs</U> by
		federally recognized polygraphists, current <U>handwriting matches</U>,
		the identification of <B>Nathan</B> Salmon as agent Dettling's
		stepson, and <U>independent confirmation by three individuals</U>
		familiar with my handwriting prior to the notes publication.
	</P>

	<P class=intro>
		<A href="GezerNathanNews.htm#NoInterview">Ten Thousand FBI 302
			forms</A> (interview records) exist for every single Nathan last name R
		individual in the USA. But none exist for the individual, the former <B>Solomonic</B>
		Gate Excavator, who passed a polygraph saying he wrote it, provided a
		matching handwriting sample, three independent identifications of his
		handwriting's similarity to the note, and an identification of who
		Nathan was !!! Instead of an FBI interview, the Excavator of the Gate
		is left on his own "Digging for Truth" in real life, just like the
		title of the documentary.

	<BR>
	<P class=intro>With the site now the leading conspiracy site on the
		web, true Solomonic justice may yet be dispensed from the records of
		the Tel Gezer excavation of the Real King Solomon's Gate**&nbsp;</P>
	<BR>
	<P class=intro>In the end I believe Unabom will be regarded as a
		crime against the environment. A structured attempt by the powerful to
		discredit the early voices for sanity in the treatment of the earth as
		well as a grab for surveillance power. It has a twin in the Judith
		Bari case and in others as well, altho none quite so far reaching as
		this. As we approach the impending environmental apocalypse,
		indeed,... the "Sun may have set on everyone elses...." and its
		meaning,... the definition of eternal evil? For all of us? For all
		time?</p>

		Eleven Years, Eleven Votes, Eleven Regrets, Eleven PM, November 11,
		Sept 11 not to mention May 11... Things&nbsp; just seem to go from one
		August second to another... with a Chi-Rho here and a Chi-Rho there,
		here a street light, there a street light every where a coincidence
		and a non connection connection. Unavoidably Fascinating! <BR>

		Footnote: Years later, I mailed hundreds of Christmas Cards with the
		Papal election photos on the front and the Nathan R note graphic on
		the back along with my handwriting. If you wrote it, even the casual
		observer would laugh at the Joke, but my handwriting matched, at least
		according to the myriad of Postal Inspectors who saw it as it passed
		through their hands. Some poor recipients actually had panic attacks,
		apparently I ruined one poor lady's christmas that I heard about.
		Anyway, I finally got my 302 at the Liberty Mutual Insurance offices
		in Portsmouth NH, on what was my last day at work there. I took no
		guff, jabbing my finger at them with ... "<i><b>and you know
				damn well....</b></i>". I wonder if a 302 is still on the record on this
		one.... apparently my very angry and aggressive nature during the
		conversation with the two FBI agents, which was witnessed by a number
		of my co-workers through the glass was... how do you say... a little
		out of the ordinary for such a button down industry :) <br>
