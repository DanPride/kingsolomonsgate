<P  align=center>Intersection<br>US Route 302 and Albion Road<BR>
Windham, Maine<BR>
August 1965?</p>
<br>
<P class=ref align=center>I lay sprawled across the old style bench front seat
of the car. My 12 year old legs propped on the center hump and my <i>head against the handle
of the passenger door</i>. I had been intently studying the box of shotgun shells
during the ride home from the lake.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>My brother had just gotten his license. As I sprawled 
accross the seat the sun played through the trees as we traversed the country roads.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>I was not excited to be riding with him.
The relationship had never been good. I was born an RH baby on <b>Mothers day</b> in a difficult delivery in which both mother and son almost died. My 3 years older brother had never gotten over the shift in attention. Attempts at a Resolution had preceded today. At 18 months I was thrown down the stairs of <a href="images/FamilyPhotos/1952_PridesThanksGiving.gif">547 Main St</a> Westbrook suffering a broken collar bone. The first of a series of sudden attacks that seem to come out of nowhere with no warning.
At Six there had been the game of Pirates on Easter morning, where of course
I "walked the plank" with my new red <b>Easter</b> tie as the blindfold. My brother had awoken me with a super nice "lets play"
tone in his voice. It seemed thrilling to have suddenly become liked. He posed me kneeling on the edge of the top bunk bed
with a blindfold made from a tie wrapped around my eyes. I heard and felt him maneuver behind as I wondered what Pirates was all about.
He braced his back against the wall, put both feet in the middle of my back and launched me across the room
with a sudden kick. I got six stitches in the Chin and blood all over my New Easter Tie in exchange for my misplaced trust.
I was kind of a sucker as a kid, this wasn't the first time for that sort of thing nor would it be the last. Thirty years later, my sister laughingly telling the story at a christmas party, all but ended our relationship. I found the expectation that I laugh too to be a bit much.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>But today, I had been thankful for the peaceful ride.
I sat there studying the box of shells studiously and peering at my Brother at
the wheel. We sat there at 302 and Albion Road for a long pause. I stirred beginning
to wonder what was going on, what was taking so long, what was he studying
over my head so intently. As I looked, my brothers neck craned back and forth
as he seemed to be carefully examining the on coming traffic to the right. The intersection
provided a clear and unobstructed view.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>He slammed his foot down on the accelerator and
the car took off with a roar. A short roar, followed by a tremendous crash as the
car whirled in circles from the impact of the oncoming auto. The Car, and all,
spun around in a dizzying whirl amid crashing and screeching sounds.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>The other driver approached the car hurriedly, opened the
passenger door and got me out. He was profuse with apologies worry and panic all at
once. Simultaneously he was thanking God and anyone who would listen (including my father
when he arrived), that he had been able to abruptly turn his car and only hit the front passenger tire, nearly separating it from the vehicle. But for that I would have been killed outright.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>As the adults stood in a gaggle around the car I remember the voice of the distraught driver floating over the sound of the passing traffic as he spoke directly at our father... "But he was looking right at me...".</p><p><br>
