		John sat across from me staring in disbelief. I could tell he was
		wondering if I had gone crazy. He was back visiting from medical
		school, I was just back from traveling the world. I was still trying
		to finish and get my BA, he was well on his way to being Dr John
		Hellerstedt Texas MD. A smarter person probably would have dropped it
		but I was upset. I had already run into this a lot, but I had no idea
		then that it would become a <b>lifelong pattern</b> and would <b>transfer
		from event to event</b>. John knew me and knew me well. He was my Vice
		President in my first term as Student Body President. His reputation
		went a long way to getting me elected the first time. He was a
		respected person in the community. I had valued his opinions for
		years. I was upset that even he would not believe me. &quot;John, I'm
		telling you they are killing people in Droves, <b>Millions</b> I am
		telling you.&quot; &quot;Look you know me... I am not making this
		stuff up &quot;. I related some of the horror stories I had been told
		first hand by the people who lived them while working the <b>refugee
			evacuation</b>. His brow furrowed as I described a refugee telling of
		hiding in the bushes with his daughter and having to stay silent while
		they killed the rest of his family with the dreaded blue bags, so that
		he and his daughter could survive. John could see the emotional strain
		in me as I told the story. &quot;Yea but maybe it was just that you
		got caught up a series of isolated events and you are generalizing it.
		Look it had to be upsetting&quot; He was trying to reconcile his
		former opinion of me with the unbelievable story he was now hearing.
	</p>
	<br>
	<P class=intro align=center>&quot;Dan it just doesn't make
		sense&quot; John said as he shook his head. &quot;Look if it was as
		bad as you say we would have heard about it.&quot; Something like that
		would be in the headlines, on the news, on the radio. You are telling
		me millions of people

	are being slaughtered and you are the only person who knows about it?
	&quot;No a lot of people know about it, but the press refuses to
	believe it or print it&quot; I said. I knew this for a fact. I had been
	run out of the only place to get a good hamburger in Bangkok in those
	years (the embassy cafeteria) for making a big scene screaming at some
	dumb journalist who was full of himself and his own self importance. It
	was his crack that I was stupid and being duped by propaganda that had
	really put me over the top. His dismissive attitude at the lowly peace
	corps volunteer, come I.C.E.M refugee evacuation officer, who wasn't
	really worth his time made my blood boil. He actually had scoffed at me
	when I offered to take him into the camps. About that time I really got
	into his face and drew the guards attention. I was there, in the camps,
	I knew.
	<P class=intro align=center>Over the years I had become a little
		compulsive trying to tell people about what I had seen. Some of the
		students on campus that year (1978 -Kids to me at this point) had
		begun to make fun of me. I was the burnout. Having been respected at
		one point in this same place, the ridicule stung a bit. Even long time
		friends like Meadville musician Tim Smith had noticeably changed
		attitudes toward me over it. With John I would not give up*.
	<P class=intro align=center>In the end it yielded a small
		satisfaction when the movie "The Killing Fields" came out. Today few
		remember that the Cambodian holocaust was a public secret for years.
		Dr John Hellerstedt MD did however. When I talked to him years later,
		he was astounded at the turn of events. My tirade that day across the
		booth's wooden table in the campus grill was remembered. I could tell
		I had his respect once again, and that was important to me.</p>

	* To this day whenever the media starts screaming about some big
	generalized threat or other (Bird Flu 2005, Ebola 2014) the effect on
	me is mentally devastating, no sleep, semi hysterical, embarrassing to
	say. Very unpleasant times. I wind up trashing personal relationships
	in my psychic thrashing around that accompanies these events, along
	with a deep sense of desperation. They didn't get me on Y2K tho. I knew
	that one was a lot of bunk.
