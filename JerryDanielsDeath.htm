		<FONT face="Times bold" color=#000000 size=+1>One of the most
			contentious issue in the POW controversy is how are POWs tied to the
			drug issue. Are they? Are they also tied to other issues? This site
			will tackle this issue as perhaps no other site has before.
			<P>Are POWs tied to the drug issue? I believe they are. First,
				the area where many POWs were lost is Laos, home of drug dealing
				between it and Vietnam during the war. As I wrote in Trails of
				Deceit, �Did the �dope� angle keep site 85, a strategic asset, from
				being protected by American forces? Did the CIA believe too many
				eyes would compromise too many secrets?� I credit Kiss the Boys
				Goodbye with tackling the issue, although it did get unduly attacked
				by many on my ideological side, conservative, as being too �left
				-wing.� Attacking dope dealers in the government is neither liberal
				nor conservative. It is the right attacking the wrong. Intelligence
				gathering should be done correctly not leaving open the opportunity
				for exploitive behavior hiding behind patriotism
			<P>The issue first arose in 1978 when LTC Albert Shinkle, a DIA
				operative in Laos, testified before a Congressional Subcommittee
				headed by Congressman Lester Wolff. Shinkle testified about POWs and
				was asked questions about the dope trafficking and intelligence
				forces. Acknowledging the problem, Shinkle made these points:
			<P>* Some of the Meo we were backing �raised opium.�
			<P>* Air Force Intelligence �made a decision... to stay out of
				the opium business...�
			<P>* On the relationship between intelligence and drug
				trafficking, Shinkle said, �... we were not letting them do that
				(traffic) so we could gather intelligence ... we were looking the
				other way to let them make money so that they would let us fight a
				war in Laos...�
			<P>* On CIA and Air America, Shinkle said, �while having no
				personal knowledge... it was common gossip... CIA aircraft or Air
				America aircraft transporting... narcotics. I never saw a Royal Lao
				Air Force aircraft transport any either, but I didn�t always go out
				and look...� (Trails of Deceit pg. 25)

			<P>In September 1996, GEN MAJ Jan Sejna testified that chemical
				experiments were done on POWs in Korea and South Vietnam. I outlined
				a place, highly suspected of holding our POWs as being a place where
				that chemical interrogation took place. At the bottom of this page,
				you�ll find a link to that revelation in my book. For this purpose,
				what I wrote was �Besides evidence of live Americans emerging from
				Vietnam came a pattern of possible corruption in the intelligence
				agencies supposedly looking for our POWs. The cover was �POWs.� The
				real object - drug trafficking and a �Super CIA' responsible to no
				one...� I learned, before the book Kiss the Boys Goodbye was
				printed, about alleged growing of poppies around �Au Phi� prison
				camp. In 1989, I learned about charges made by LTC Bo Gritz on the
				subject of drug trafficking, Khun Sa, and POWs. In October, 1990, I
				met with Gritz in Phoenix and watched the editing of his video
				interview with Khun Sa - the whole over 2 hour version and saw his
				edited version. Here is what they charged:
			<P>* Gritz wrote that �Unfortunately, Khun Sa knew nothing about
				US POWs.�
			<P>* Khun Sa said instead that he wanted out of the drug trade.
			<P>* He wanted political concessions affecting his people.
			<P>* He charged that the American people �have been mislead to
				look upon us as the main source of all the drug problems...�
			<P>* Khun Sa charged that his investigation found �some high
				officials in the US Government�s ... with the influence of corrupted
				persons objected to our active participation in the drugs
				eradication program... (to) retain their profitable self-interest
				from the continuation of the drug problems...�
			<P>Khun Sa then named those who he believed were involved and the
				names were not low level personnel. These are his charges and have
				not been proven nor have they been reliably investigated. All those
				charged have said they were innocent - Khun Sa may have ulterior
				motives tied to the Chinese for making the charges - Khun Sa is an
				acknowledged drug lord - yet, no one has looked into the charges -
				under oath - and some have been prone in the past to dodge the
				bullet on direct questioning on the charges. Some have had links to
				questionable decisions on giving reliable information on POWs. A
				full scale investigation on what was charged in Kiss the Boys
				Goodbye and what Gritz uncovered has never been done. Until that is
				done, those charged by Khun Sa by his own self admitted �secret
				investigation,� need to clear the air about their involvement or
				non-involvement - straight up - no dodging - no equivocating - like
				every other public person is having to undergo in Washington, D.C.
				prior to being appointed to high posts. Without this public airing
				and cleansing, the doubts will remain.
			<P>Khun charged �CIA Chief in Laos, Theodore Shackley was in the
				drug business, having contacts with the opium warlord Lor Sing
				Han...�
			<P>* �Santo Trafficante acted as his buying and transporting
				agent ...� perhaps a hold over from his alleged involvement with CIA
				in Cuba in decades earlier �arrangements�
			<P>* �Richard Armitage handled the financial section with the
				banks in Australia... after the Vietnam War ended, when ... Armitage
				was being posted to ... Thailand, his dealings in the drug business
				continued ... after 1979 ... Armitage resigned from the US Embassy�s
				posting and set up the �Far East Trading Company� as a front for his
				continuation in the drug trade and to bribe CIA agents in Laos...�
				�For over ten years, Armitage supported his men in Laos and Thailand
				with the profits from his drug trade and most of the cash were
				deposited... in Australia ...�
			<P>* �Daniel Arnold was made to handle the drug business as well
				as the transportation of arms sales...�
			<P>* �Jerry Daniels then took over the drug trade from Richard
				Armitage...�
			<P>LTC Gritz urged Washington to �look into the possibility that
				political appointees ... are guilty of bypassing our Constitutional
				process ... promoting illegal covert operation, conspired in the
				trafficking of narcotics and arms.� Gritz wondered why a secretary
				for Armitage asked him, �Why would he have us expunge his official
				record of ... past POW/MIA assignments and activities?� and :
			<P>* �It was about the same time a CIA agent named by Khun Sa
				(Jerry Daniels) �turned up dead in Bangkok under �mysterious
				circumstances� (gassed to death in his apartment)...� and;
			<P>* �also about this time, as an agent of NSC�s Intelligence
				Support Activity, I was told by ISA Chief Jerry King, �... there are
				still too many bureaucrats ... who don�t want to see POWs returned
				alive.� I failed to realize the fullness of his meaning ... until
				... General Khun Sa, ... named (Armitage) as a key connection in a
				ring of heroin trafficking mobsters and US government officials.�
				and;
			<P>* Gritz charged that an agent he knew told him the charges
				were true �by his own personal knowledge...� and;
			<P>* TIME, May 4, 1988, pg. 18 told of Ross Perot�s attempt to
				see if there were any connection and his getting stopped in his
				tracks.

			<P>As a former intelligence officer with heavy ties to the CIA
				(Phoenix), I know how the system is supposed to work with checks and
				balances. Yet, as I nose around the POW issue, I keep running into
				allegations of drug trafficking, arms trafficking, �off-line�
				operations, CIA "rogue" operations, and what Gritz referred to as
				the �Super CIA.� I wrote about Martin Anderson�s charges from his
				book Revolution that as a member of the Foreign Intelligence
				Advisory Board, he saw what he called the Super CIA that �never did
				get a full-scale test before it was exposed and killed.� It was
				based upon the old OSS rendering of the British model of �off-line�
				operations funded by �off-line� enterprises to keep Congress and
				other �meddlers� out of the know of what was being done by CIA. It
				began in 1948, if not earlier, when CIA chiefs �passed the hat�
				among their wealthy graduates to �fund covert operations in
				peacetime.� The CIA then used companies of these graduates as
				�conduits for CIA secret funds.� Some past graduates were listed in
				the Espionage Establishment (pgs. 124-27) including Sarah T. Hughes
				(the judge who swore Johnson in as President after Kennedy was
				assassinated) and Leon Jaworski of Watergate fame.
			<P>It was in this context, that I was told by several �sources�
				in and out of intelligence that if Iran-Contra had come off as
				planned, it would be a prelude to some offering of the same sort on
				POWs. Of course if true, then why not do it in some other way,
				without the questionable procedures. It is also possible that the
				shut down of Iran-Contra also shut down the return of POWs. (Another
				story for another part of the Forum linked below)
			<P>As I wrote in my Epilogue in Trails of Deceit, �The drug
				connection is one that is evolving (in my investigations) and I have
				made more contemporaneous contacts with people who shall remain in
				the background. The ones I have made convince me even more about the
				existence of the rogue element in our intelligence agencies that
				need to be checked. Our system is set up to be exploited by these
				elements and they have rushed in to fill the void.� (In this
				context, I am talking about a �generic they� and not any specific
				people) �As I was told, the POW-MIAs became problems to other issues
				and were exploited for their value to hide other exploits. Let me
				make it explicit one more time, the material covering Shackley,
				Armitage, etc., are charges made by others. I have covered those
				charges. My personal opinion is that these allegations (to which all
				have said they are innocent) must be investigated fully and
				completely to lay to rest all suspicions surrounding them.�
			<P>As I point out in another section (linked at the bottom), the
				CIA would have reason to deny the drug experimentation that Sejna
				charged happened to our POWs. They did not want to expose their own
				operations. I also charged that there might be �off-line� operations
				that they did not want exposed. At that time, I did not have the
				proof of �rogue� operations. Now, I do. One of those �rogue�
				operations resulted in harm to an active - duty Special Forces
				operative �sheep-dipped� into a CIA operation. I know the operative,
				having met him after returning from Vietnam and my tour in Phoenix.
				I will offer the proof of the �rogue� part of the operation. If CIA
				can do this to �one of their own� then they can do it to unreturned
				POWs and unrepatriated MIAs. (See link below)
			<P>Shinkle had testified, as part of the drug hearing earlier
				reported, that CIA had hampered the Air Force in their own MIA
				operations. It so happens that one lead the they did turn up
				buttressed a later set of circumstances that lead to the only post
				war POW rescue (Nhom Marrott in Laos in 1981 and linked to at the
				bottom). Shinkle and Air Force Intelligence found one of the first
				eye witnesses to live POWs in the Kham Keut area. He also had ties
				to sources in the Laotian government verifying live POW existence
				post 1973. In fact, his �6499th Special Activities Group... an Air
				Force clandestine intelligence collection group...� conducted
				sensitive operations with Thai intelligence sources including, in
				1968, a �Pathet Lao Junior Officer� with knowledge of Kham Keut�s
				use, on a regular basis, as a detention center.� The 1972 operation
				above, provided an eyewitness to that fact. At first, people
				wondered if "professional jealousy" on the part of two intelligence
				agencies provided the charge of CIA interference in POW
				investigations. However, the charge really needs investigation in
				itself since allegations on other misconduct have appeared and are
				still in the making.
			<P>
				Are the POWs and drug trafficking connected? A few years ago, I
				would have said no. A few years ago, I would have denied charges of
				a "rogue" CIA operation also. I know better now. As I said, people
				on the conservative side need to open their eyes a bit and realize
				that all charges from the "left" are not automatically wrong. The
				CIA is not "automatically right." A few years ago, I vigorously
				denied "assassination" was part of the Phoenix Program. At my level,
				I still deny it. However, our intelligence agencies, especially the
				CIA, are so compartmentalized that serious misconduct can slip
				through easily. As I said earlier, this is not conservative versus
				liberal. This is right versus wrong. We need a full scale "look" to
				see that right is done and wrong, if done, is eliminated. Then, fix
				the machine so it will work properly. Don't use POWs as a cover for
				this type of operation, or anything else. If there are POWs, which I
				believe, negotiate them home; repatriate the reamins; and then
				legitimately work on the "bigger issues." Not before! <BR>
