	<H1 align=center>Faux Figure Called Gauguin's 'Faun' Gets Goat Of

	<p class="intro" align="Center">CHICAGO - A half-man, half-goat
		ceramic figure supposedly sculpted by 19th century French artist Paul
		Gauguin has delighted aficionados visiting the Art Institute of
		Chicago for a decade, but now the museum says "The Faun" is a fake.
		"No one could think of any other instance in which anything like this
		happened here," the director of public affairs at the institute, Erin
		Hogan, told the Chicago Tribune for a story posted Tuesday on its Web
		site. "So we don't have experience in this area." The museum said the
		sculpture is among scores of forgeries produced by the Greenhalgh
		family, which has been under investigation by authorities in Great
		Britain for nearly two years. A private dealer bought the piece at
		Sotheby's in 1994, and the art institute purchased it from the dealer
		three years later. A British judge sentenced Shaun Greenhalgh, 47, to
		four years and eight months in prison last month. His mother, Olive,
		83, received a suspended term of 12 months, and his father, George,
		84, was to be sentenced later. Shaun Greenhalgh created the fakes,
		while his parents handled most of the sales. All three pleaded guilty
		this year to defrauding art institutions and other buyers over 17
		years. They had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to laundering the
		proceeds from the sale of a fake Egyptian statuette. The creations by
		the Greenhalghs also included Assyrian stone reliefs and several
		copies of paintings by American artist Henry Moran. Hogan declined to
		reveal the purchase price of the discredited piece and said the art
		institute was talking with Sotheby's and the private dealer about
		possible compensation. "Everyone who bought and sold the work did so
		in good faith," he said.
