	<p align="Center">
		The Wonder Bar<br> Boston Mass<br> Oct 2004
	</p>
	<P align=center>Oh my God, I ran into Kevin Ryan again. He winced
		at the sharpness of the handshake, but it is the handshake I give to
		those I consider friends. I had stopped into Bunratty's again to
		re-examine the place where so many things had happened around me.
		Funny but he was never a part of the &quot;scene&quot;. He was the
		ghetto landlord where I made my living whilst I partied and lived the
		nascent Boston Heavy Metal scene. He never knew the people who
		populated the scene. He never new Abel. I was staring at the bullet
		holes in the ceiling that killed him when a stranger walked up to talk
		to me. After a few forgettable sentences he excitedly told me that
		&quot;Kevin Ryan was downstairs&quot;. He then proceeded to lead me
		down to the basement bar of what was now the &quot;Wonder Bar&quot; to
		reintroduce me. I have no idea how the out of the blue leap of the
		strangers conversation to Kevin Ryan even occurred. I walked up and
		sat next to him without notice as the stranger stood by. He began to
		stare with amazement. &quot;Danny Pride&quot; he said with a
		sudden&nbsp; twinkle of Irish Eyes?</P>
	<P align=center>He was as blown away as I.</P>
	<P align=center>Like two Irishmen we were quickly to drunk to talk
		and spent most of the evening in a good natured stupor. But somewhere
		near the beginning he exclaimed.... &quot;Don got out a while back and
		he's working for me again&quot;. I stumbled and said &quot;what do you
		mean &quot;Got out&quot;... how's he doing anyway&quot; ? &quot;Oh,
		you didn't know&quot; ? he queried with a puzzled look. &quot;He's
		been in prison for the last ten years or so&quot;. &quot;WHAT&quot;???
		&quot;Yea he got into an argument with a guy in an apartment and it
		resulted in a fight and he killed the guy, hit him on the head&quot;.</P>
	<P align=center>About thirty seconds later I groaned. Oh no... Oh
		shit.</P>
	<P align=center>My first reaction had been to Don dealing with
		prison... then the second thought of the incredible guilt he would be
		living with.&nbsp; Don had been Kevin's maintenance guy and general
		all round fixer. He was also a friend of mine. Now another, yet
		another, murder had breached my world and connected me to it.</P>
	<P align=center>The flashback was to Don's house down somewhere
		near Mattapan, maybe in 1988, I think. Kevin had stuck me with a House
		in Roxbury at an inflated price, his ego reacting to my humanity
		towards his tenants. Don was trying to show me how to make it work. He
		was away that day and I had been frantically looking for him. The dump
		Kevin stuck me with had broken a sewer line, Two kids lived with the
		couple of squatters on the first floor. The one guy who had the moxie
		to go at the problem was no where to be seen for hours, Around late
		dusk he showed up all in a tizzy. He reminded me of someone who had
		just won an Oscar and had dodged bullets on the way to the stage to
		collect the trophy and was now back home to tell friends about it.</P>
	<P align=center>&quot;Oh My God you won't believe what I just
		did&quot;. he exclaimed! &quot;I just faced down a whole gang of
		Bikers and threw them out of the place&quot;. He paced back and forth,
		agitated at all the excitement. &quot;It was incredible&quot; &quot;It
		was awesome&quot; &quot;I just saved Kevin six months on that
		building&quot;.&nbsp; The adrenaline of the moment added more
		sentences which pass by my memory... but I remembered trying to call
		him up short. &quot;Don that was fucking stupid as shit&quot; I poked
		at him with all the words I had learned growing up near a race track.
		&quot;You got away with it this time but what if they had pulled a gun
		back and then one went off or something&quot;. &quot;You never know
		what can happen&quot; I advised &quot;What if you get into a struggle
		someday and it gets out of hand, you hit the guy and kill him....what
		then...then you gotta live with it.&quot;. In 1988 the words seemed to
		have an effect. I did bring him up short on it that day, Now they came
		back at me, it was like the conversation in the Door to the Lobby of
		the US West Yellow pages building in Denver with the columbine
		shooters all over again.</P>
	<P align=center>Ryan had helped him after it was all over,</P>
	<P align=center>Character is more than a building.</P>
