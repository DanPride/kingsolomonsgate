		<b>A Cigarette before Columbine</b>
	</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>Time for another cigarette. I rode the
		elevator down to the first floor of the US West Yellow pages
		headquarters in inverness. A pit stop in the marble bathrooms, and I
		headed outside to join the cache of smokers standing just outside the
		door. I was still smoking three packs a day in those days.</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>As I made my way across the entrance
		hall I paused to talk with the temp receptionist again*. The
		conversation turned to travel and languages. When she found out I
		spoke German she got excited and began talking about her nephew. He
		was headed in a bad way she thought. He was part of this group called
		the trench coat mafia, bad elements she thought. He idolized Germany
		and that might give me some influence with him, would I be willing to
		talk to him? He went to nearby Columbine High. She seemed a little
		desperate so I said sure kinda of casually, and hurried outside to
		join a friend for a butt.</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>A few days later my phone rang and it
		was the receptionist*. Her step-nephew(?) was coming over and would be
		here in a few minutes. Vaguely recalling my casual commitment I said
		sure and started down. I needed another cig anyway.</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>
		I met the pair in the entranceway to the building. We exchanged
		greetings in German and a few words. I was a little amused when they
		reached out to shake my hand with a misplaced reverence. <img
			border="1" align=left HSpace=10 VSpace=10 src="images/JFKClinton.gif">
		To this day the encounter reminds me of the picture of Clinton shaking
		JKF's hand.
	</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>After a few paragraphs of halting
		German we switched to English and began to talk about Germany. I told
		them about living in Germany, busking on the Marienplatz in Munich,
		and other things I don't recall now... Then they brought up Hitler. It
		set me back on my heels a bit. Here were two nice kind of Goofy all
		american teenagers in the heartland of Colorado talking about that
		murderous bastard like he was an idol. I did my best to dissuade them
		of the thought. I brought up my time in Cambodia and how horrible it
		had been to be even that close to a genocide. The conversation
		faltered, stumbled and they left.</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>
		I had been dethroned in their eyes.<br>

	<p class=quote align=center>
		<br> Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on several weeks later to
		kill a teacher and twelve students, and maim multitudes in the
		Columbine High massacre. They chose April 20, 1999, Hitlers Birthday,
		as their self described "Judgment Day". Their home video series taken
		before the Massacre includes a segment which appears to be them
		driving up to the US West Yellow Pages building on Inverness. When and
		if it is released to the public a copy will appear here. I am very
		curious to hear the voice track that goes with it. I have only seen a
		brief segment on public TV so far and did not catch the audio, which
		appeared to be cut short.
	</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>I haven't yet figured out all the
		Biblical links here but I feel confident that more exist, they seem to
		pop up eventually in all these things. The twelve students (apostles)
		and the teacher (Christ) and the Burning Bush as a threat to the
		Browns are obvious. But there may be more, my knowledge of the
		Biblical text is still rudimentary, as it deepens perhaps "bells will
		ring". I have yet to research Columbine in detail, not a pleasant task
		and one I tend to put off. It took me thirty years to finally read a
		book on Gacy (Feb 2006). It shocked me to my core and paralyzed me for
		months when I finally did. But I will get around to it.</p>
	<p class=quote align=center>
		I don't know why the connections, particularly the new testament
		connections, are often so violent and distorted i.e. <a
			href="ElevenRegrets.htm">Gacy</A> murdering 33 while quoting biblical
		passages as he strangles and rapes them, the run in with the Christmas
		murder of JonBenet etc et al. It seems a pretty strange way to mark
		things... even for God. Perhaps that is somehow the point. The
		encounters are usually fleeting, a few moments in time. Often, I go on
		happily on my way, unaware at that moment that anything extraordinary
		has happened. Fortunately there are also fun ones like the Samson
		story or first Kings to lighten the read. They have actually been
		quite numerous, often funny, but they seem minor and are often
		undocumented by comparison,... they admittedly don't match the impact.

		<b>Documentary Sources:</b> The receptionist was a 50ish portly woman
		with greying black hair. Her exact relationship is fuzzy. Nephew, Step
		Nephew whatever. There was nothing to set the incident apart at the
		time it occurred. Documentation here is scanty, I am hoping the recent
		Harris Home video tape release will be of assistance. Lon
		Schlitenhart, a USW employee may be able to be of substantial
		assistance. <a

		<b>Update 2014</b> - They announced with Great Fan fair that they are going
		to destroy the tapes. They made it sound like a public service. They
		sold the actual Natan R note, obviously it will go the way of Kennedys
		brain etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. Somehow it seems to be patriotic to
		destroy evidence of real history, or at least they make it sound that
		way. Supposedly, now no one will follow their lead,... right. That
		truth would be better served by a good look at these bozo's is quite
		irrelevant. If you have ever watched any of the ones they did release
		you quickly realize these guys were a clown car and public interest
		would be better served by a full airing. I consider the accusations
		that they were influenced to be credible enough to be examined, but it
		never will be. If the Heavens Gate cult leader can convince his
		followers to castrate themselves for a pair of new tennis shoes, just
		imagine what our wonderful 911 based Government can do with two
		complete bozo teenagers as subjects and the best PHDs in the world
		running the washing machine that scrubs their brains ! Evidence destruction
		is a Gate pattern beyond any machinations of the powerful however, and deserves a page
		of its own soon. The pattern is really strong, Numerous examples i.e. I call an ex girlfriend whom
		I had exchanged love letters for years with only to find out she had burned
		 them recently after saving them forever and she has no idea why !
