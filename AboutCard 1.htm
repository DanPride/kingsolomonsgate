<BODY><BR><P align=Center>Some have misinterpreted the message on this years Christmas Card.<br>
It is supposed to be a joke thus the :). <br><br>
"Looks like its all about Revelations in the End !"<br>
It is intended to be the ultimate stupid statement.<br>
i.e. here I am stealing the Pope's Habemus (<a href="Video/PopeAnnounced.asf">Video</a>) and experiencing
<br>numerous improbable religiously oriented events<BR> and<BR> I am just about knowledgable enough
to know what the title of the last chapter is !.<br>
<br>The Nathan R note was indeed written by me and published in the NY Times<br>
But of course I am no Bomber except in the spiritual sense <b>:)</b><br>
The facts of the  note, and the ongoing denial of Justice for Judge Vance are groundshaking events
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/">More</a><br><br>
They are just two of the <b>dozens</b> of outlandish and improbable events in the last 30 years<br>
that all seem to track back (in some offbeat out of left field manner)<BR>
to the Solomonic Gate via parable, word play, coincidence and meaning<br><br>
Whats it all mean?<br>
You got me !<br><br>
But I hope you will enjoy these stories<br>of what happened after the first biblical proof <br>and that the strange quirks of fate will be of interest to you<br>and entertain you in this holiday season.<br>
