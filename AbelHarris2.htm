		My friend Abel Harris said to me one day <br>"I am Abel, you know
		like in the Bible? I am my brothers keeper."<br> and was shot in
		the head that very day by a <u>co<b><i>cain</i></b>e
		</u> crazed jerk<br>in a heroic effort to save other people and "Be

		<b>"Hey, I am Abel, you know like in the Bible, I am my Brothers
			Keeper" Abel said.</b> The game of hearts included Gypsy Blanchette,
		Abel, A J Wachtel?, and several other Boston Heavy Metal fans. We all
		sat in a circle in the living room of my apartment at 1353 Beacon
		Street #2 in Brookline. My Nine room rent control had become the
		after-hours hot spot of bunrattys bar to Peter Thompson's displeasure.
		It was a slow evening, things had actually calmed down enough towards
		dawn that Abel pulled out a deck of cards and started a game. Now wait
		a minute I replied " Are you crazy? They don't pay you enough for
		that!. Abel your a Bouncer, don't let it go to your head and do
		something stupid". "No I mean it", Abel continued getting a little
		full of himself, "I am responsible for those people in that bar. If
		someone comes in with a knife or a gun or whatever, that's my job, I
		got to handle it". Gypsy suddenly interrupted "Yea OK Abel, ...you go
		ahead and save the world... but <U>Deal the Damn Cards"</U> !! A word
		from on high ended the discussion for the moment...Gypsy was the Queen
		Bee of bunrattys, the ruling social queen of the Heavy Metal scene, if
		that's possible in a bar whose social scene ran at the speed of a
		universal cocaine high.
	<P align=left>Abel was in his prime. I liked Abel, Just about
		everybody in our crowd did. He reminded me of myself in the days when
		I ran the Student Government at college. He was about the only black
		guy in the bar many evenings, but he carried it off well. Somehow he
		managed to keep a sense of himself in the rarefied atmosphere of the
		soon to be famous Boston Heavy Metal scene. He was someone you could
		genuinely trust, in a crowd of people that defined the term
		outrageous. He took great delight in his new found position of social
		standing, not to mention in the attentions of several of the bars
		finer women. Still, Gypsy's slight seemed appropriate, the status, the
		drugs, the attention and the women had Abel overestimating the
		situation, or so it seemed to me at the time. After all, even tho he
		had replaced the fisticuffs of the previous regime with psych and tact
		successfully, it was after all still just a Biker Bar gone Metal in a
		non descript backwater of the Boston Scene. The use of the term
		"Responsibility" in the context seemed overplayed for sure. Who knew
		so many of the regular Bunratty acts would rule MTV's early years
		three short years later.
	<P>
	<P align=left>The evening wound down and everyone slowly got
		themselves out the door and I went to sleep. The next evening after
		the days work, I landed again at Buns, for almost three years I never
		missed a night. It was a rocking good night. The place was packed.</P>
	<P align=left>I was standing at the end of the Bar away from the
		stage near the door between the slats and the bar when the first shot
		rang out. I have always been blessed with quick reactions to dangerous
		situations and was in a crouch and half way down the bar before most
		people realized what was happening. The band kept playing for the
		first several shots as the crowd started to react ...slowly at first.
		I looked over my right shoulder across the crowd as I made my way down
		the bars length while the Gunshots continued to ring out. Somebody was
		standing on the entrance landing shooting a gun into the air, bullets
		crashing into the ceiling above the crowd. One shot, two, three and by
		four I was near the end of the Bar and trying to figure out where to
		go next to avoid being trapped in the Men's room. I had no idea what
		was happening other than that it was definitely time to go... During
		that last quarter of the bars length the crowd was now crouching and
		moving toward the stage in a mass. The people looked like stalks of
		wheat being blown by a ferocious wind all bending and moving in the
		same direction...away from the gunman. One figure, standing straight
		up, his head feet above the crouching crowd, was moving in the
		opposite direction against the crowd and toward the gunman. As he
		traversed the last ten feet he began to hold his hands up in the air,
		palms open and toward the gunman. It is a sight I will never forget.
		Fortunately for my sleep at night I missed what happened next. I was
		too concentrated on survival to play the tourist on this one. Those
		shots were real and the paced two and three second intervals seemed to
		carry an incredible terrifying threat.
	<P align=left>
		The Gunman emptied his gun into the ceiling... all except for that
		last shot. As Abel made his way up the landing to confront him, feet
		away from the barking pistol, now alone and standing by himself, James
		Wallace dropped his hand and shot the last rounds directly into Abel's
		head, then left the bar running like the coward he was. James
		Wallace...the scum... with the snout full of co<B>caine murdered
			Abel, August 1, 1987</B>.
	</P>
	<P align=left>
		When Abel Harris said "I am my brothers keeper" sitting in <U>my</U>
		living room at sunrise on the very day he was shot...he, unlike almost
		all others who ever uttered that phrase... really meant it.
	</P>
	<P align=left>God be with you Abel.</P>
	<br>
	<P class=bible align=center>But Cain had words with his brother
		Abel, and when they were out in the field, Cain assaulted his brother
		Abel and killed him. Then the Lord asked Cain, "Where is your brother
		Abel?" He said "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>

		The next morning after spending all night at St Elizabeth's Hospital
		in Allston I wearily returned home but although exhausted could not
		sleep. I called the newspaper and told them what I had seen. The <a
			href="Abel/AbelShot.htm"><img src="images/AbelPrideQuote.gif"
			alt="BostonHerald" width="298" height="156" hspace="10" vspace="5"
			border="1" align="right"></a> reporter had not a clue and the paper
		was going to just note the event in a paragraph on Boston Crime. We
		talked for about half an hour as the sun came up. The reporter mangled
		most of what I said that morning, and attributed some quotes to me
		that were not mine. But buried in the <a href="Abel/AbelShot.htm">extensive
			quotes</a> is one of particular interest from our conversation the night
		before. It is a paraphrase of what Abel had said the night before.
		"Hey I am Able, you know like in the Bible... I am my brothers
		keeper... <b>if there is a problem in the bar I have to handle it"</b>.
		The Biblical part of the quote was dropped, perhaps it seemed
		unfashionable at the time. Most of the talk over the next few days was
		over the very last hand Abel held as the guys were trying to goad the
		girls into a round of strip poker at the end of the evening... Aces
		and Eights. <a href="Abel/AbelFuneral.htm"> <img border="1"
			src="images/AbelMinisterQuote_Tmb.gif" align="left" hspace="10"
			vspace="6" width="277" height="288"></a>Someone pointed out the
		myth of the "Dead Mans Hand", and Able put the hand down with a laugh
		announcing "That's it, I'm outta here on that one" and everyone left.
		The evening was over. It was now Sunrise of Abel's Last day as he made
		his way from my apartment.

		<i> Numerological Oddity: Wallace shot Abel on August 1, 1987. FBI
			records will show that my first call to turn in Dettling, in an
			attempt to prevent additional deaths and "be my brothers keeper",
			occurred August 1, 1995. August 2, 1995, the next day was the Day the
			Manifesto excerpts were first published in the NY Times. That was the
			day I knew for sure who was at the center of the June 20 1992
			Bombings and my efforts began in earnest.</i>
	</P>
	<P align=left>
		In both accounts Abel has words with his killer and is then later
		killed. Oddly, I believe other similarities between the Biblical story
		and the bunrattys murder exist. The way in which the events of his
		death dovetail with the other events surrounding <a
			href="index.html#Life">King Solomon's Gate</a> to form simultaneously
		a biblical and an anti-biblical parable are striking, unusual and
		worthy of great note.
