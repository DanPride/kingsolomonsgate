		Dear Mr President<br>
		<br> <br> I request you declare a world wide state of
		emergency immediately to address the Methane issue.<br> <br>
		I caught your double entendre humor at the Washington Jefferson day
		dinner.<br> You are correct.<br> You are Jorel.<br> <br>
		But I do not think you appreciate the position we are in fully.<br>
		<br> Science tells us that there are 10,000 planets that are
		earth like.<br> Science believes that given the right
		chemicals,... "poof" <br> you have life, ipso presto,...
		evolution and all.<br> <br> But why are the Heavens Silent?<br>
		<br> Life should have developed over millions of years in lots of
		places.<br> But it would be an imperfect process,<br> in
		each case leaving its "waste calories" behind.<br> <br> When
		life becomes intelligent enough to send or listen to a signal,<br>
		it has already figured out how to mine the surplus calories of
		yesteryear.<br> <br> It is like a teenager on a Motorcycle.<br>
		Vrrrrrrrrmmmmmh Bam straight into the wall.<br> <br> In
		order for life to be heard,<br> It would have to be during the
		100 year time frame<br> from its mastery of energy to its
		destruction.<br> <br> Ironically, Life's search for Calories
		becomes its own end.<br> <br> All life everywhere that we do
		not know of, went before us.<br> <br> Perhaps George
		Washington did not get the signal.<br> <br> But do you.<br>
		<br> Will we of this planet be the great ones?<br> The ones
		to make it over the barrier.<br> <br> What are our chances?<br>
		Slim.. obviously.<br> <br> Nil if you do not act immediately
		and precipitously.<br> <br> We must strive for Greatness.<br>
		<br> Do it Now. <br> Please<br> <br>
		<br> Daniel C Pride<br> Excavator<br> King Solomons
		Gate<br> Tel Gezer, Israel 1971<br>
