<H1 align="center">Pelletier Library's Solomonic and Biblical Artifacts lost in the Meadville 
Pa Dump</H1><br>
<p align="center">Priceless archeological relics of King Solomon are lost in the 
Meadville Pa Dump.  The Artifacts were excavated from the Solomonic Gate at Gezer during 
the 1971 Allegheny College-Hebrew Union College summer study program in 
archaeology organized by campus Chaplin Don Hobson. If these artifacts are ever 
recovered, it is my wish they be donated to the Lawrence Lee Pelletier library, 
Meadville, Pa in recognition of Dr Pelletier's achievements in building and 
leading the college and in Honor of Allegheny Chaplin Don Hobson*.&nbsp; The Solomonic Gate at Tel Gezer, Israel (1971), 
from which these artifacts come, was the first 
archaeological confirmation of a Biblical passage in history. </p>

<p><b>Description of Lost Items:</b><br><a name="Vase"></a>
<b>10th Century BCE Heavy 6&quot; Tall Earthenware Perfume Vase with Handles &amp; Pointed base </B>
- This particular item was right on the edge of undisturbed strata. I actually 
argued that the item was in-situ - My supervisor after seeing me bust ass in 
120+ degree heat of the square called it &quot;out-of-situ&quot; and told me to take it 
home. This is the premier piece of the missing pieces with some interesting 
twists. Assuming perfume was a valuable item at the time of King Solomon, it's 
style may place it in the time of Solomon 
(1000 BCE). The city of Gezer was a wedding gift to King Solomon (of the many 
wives) from an unknown Pharaoh of Egypt approx 950 BCE. This item was found 
between the second and third towers of the gate where Solomon reportedly sat and 
dispensed Justice, right on the edge of undisturbed strata. Could it have been the property of King Solomon himself? The 
vase/urn was approx 2&quot; diameter with 1&quot; very think walls, a very small 
narrow cavity for perfume, pointed (not flat) base, thin neck with 2? small 
handles. Last seen in Perfect condition. A very heavy rugged object.</p>

<p>Gezer and Hazor were sister cities, both were ruled by King Solomon in the 
10th Century BCE. The above referenced plates and drawings are from Strata X (as 
in marks the spot, Hazor's Solomonic Strata) and the Late Bronze Age 2 Strata's 
immediately preceding Solomonic Rule.</p>

<p><b>Search Records</b></p>
<p>Items left in Apartment on North Street, Meadville Pa above TV Shop 
(mid-block across from supermarket  at right end of the block from the 
Apart/TV Shop perspective. Called Shillings Sylvania in one conversation) in May of 1974 in several carefully packed boxes addressed for 
shipment. Box contents included&nbsp; textbooks (each had &quot;Pride&quot; written across 
the page edges visible at a glance), Mounted Photo Exposition of Anti-Vietnam 
1972 Miami Fl demonstrations, 2 years of Campus newspapers, Pentax 
Camera, personal effects, and papers, colorful red/orange woven Israeli Shawl, 
Black rectangular flat steamer trunk. Solomonic vase was 
packed wrapped in white grocery plastic bag with 1 yr of Campus Newspapers beneath and one year 
above. Unsure if it was within the steamer trunk or the cardboard box. Unsure if 
I did or did not include a drying agent but I believe I did. I remember asking Don 
Hobson about it. I was planning to be gone at least two years in the Peace Corps. The vase 
was the absolute center of the Pack strategy, ...within something within 
something else to prevent crushing. (Although vase is very rugged). Most of the
<a href="GezerNorthStApt.htm">Apartments furniture</a> was inherited from Recht and others and was 
reportedly included in the cleanout. Broken down couch. Old 4&quot; floppy mattresses 
w blue stripes. Train trunk/something covered with 
wax(?). Recht's old wooden Drafting table. Recht's custom shelving, printing 
stuff. Standing Lamp with brass feet. Attempts to recover the items in the seventies indicated they had 
been taken to a Meadville dump by the landlord. Roommate at the time charged 
with shipping was Steve 
Harris? (76) ? definitely from Pa, former tenant at the unit was David Recht (72), John Watkins 
(72)(?). 
Unity Center associations with Recht and Apt.. Photos may exist of apartment contents among the 6 or 
7 residents during the yrs prior. Who the Landlord hired to truck the contents 
of the apt to the Dump is Unknown.</p>
<p>The artifacts will be jealously remembered by the other members of the 
Allegheny program :) Somebody from Gezer 71 may have photos of the artifacts. I 
also spent three years showing them off to anybody who would listen while at 
Allegheny, including some people from Meadville such as Jazz Musician Tim Smith.</p>
<p>The issue of the handles being single or double is confused in memory and may 
take some time to sort itself out. Vase handles may relate to specific period 
dating, but my pottery knowledge at that time (actually everybody else's as 
well) was superficial, and until recently I would 
not have known what I was looking at. There is a strong chance the vase is 
identical to the Solomonic vase <a href="GezerCXCII.htm">image 3</a>, but I can 
not say for sure. Irregardless, these artifacts carry a double whammy. Relics of 
the Solomonic era (950 BCE) are irreplaceable and priceless by themselves, but these are also 
specifically associated with the first scientific proof in history of the truth 
of a specific Passage in the Bible. They are the <u>only</u> 
archeological relics of that <u>historic</u> <u>milestone</u> that exist from 
the Solomonic Gate at Gezer itself that I am aware of. Little, if anything, was 
catalogued from the bottom of the Solomonic square&nbsp; itself, due to 
archeological &quot;rules of evidence&quot;, it was mostly... or all... out of situ.</p>
<p>Ron Nielson - currently Lyonsville Race Track - Dump Manager in 70's</p>
<p>John - <a href="mailto:Engineering@CityofMeadville.org">Current Dump administration</a> - indicates dump was closed off in 
late 70's at a 
total size of 17 Acres. Dump can be up to 60 feed deep. Test borings indicate Landfill tends to 
preserve papers, 10 year old Newspapers are still readable. Dump area active in 
74 ball parked at 5 acres. Environmental regulation changes could prove a major 
challenge to any attempts at recovery.</p>

<p>* In character spirit and relationship, the true Dumbeldoor of my life</p>
<p>** This page was posted one Month <b>before</b> the start of the second Iraq war and <b>AFTER</b> conversations with Meadville Landfill authorities. The subsequent controversy/publicity over lost archaeological artifacts soon after the war is another of the hundreds of odd coincidences since the dig, minor individually, but stunning when considered in their totality. Handwriting from the steamer trunk containing the artifacts, if it survives, will match and PREDATE the Nathan R note. <a href="NathanRNote.htm">[Nathan R Note]</a></p>
