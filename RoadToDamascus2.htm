<H1 align=center>Near Death on the Road to Damascus</H1>
<p align=center>Traveling from Beirut to Damascus</p>
<P align=center>Early August 1977<br>Six Years after King Solomon's Gate</P>
<P align=center>Sometimes you do stupid things in life. Sometimes you try to do 
stupid things in life and a backdoor backhanded twist of fate saves you from 
your stupidity. From my experience, for a westerner to spend too many years 
immersed in a strictly Buddhist far far far eastern culture particularly in and 
around a Thai civil war, on the edges of the Cambodia Killing fields, 
strengthens the tendency to do stupid things in life. The old salts always said 
"Life is cheap in Asia", what they left unsaid was that extends to your view of 
your own life as well. Crazy risks become the order of the day, Moonscaped as 
the Peace Corps Volunteers termed it or just a complete flight of all common 
sense, too many years in Asia becomes a state of mind. How long it takes just 
depends on you.</P>
<P align=center>When they handed me the ticket home after the Refugee Evacuation 
I took one look at and and said out loud "I'm not ready for this". I decided to 
cash it in and slowly reintegrate myself into western culture by going overland 
to Europe and arrived in Barcelona, Christmas day 1976. By springtime, a friend (former Chess Champ of New Zealand) and I were working as a Drivers for Iranian entrepreneurs 
driving new cars from Munich to Iran.</P>
<P align=center>The business always started at the Munich Train station. Iranians hanging in the cafe recruited drivers with western passports to form caravans of five or six brand new Peugeots. The cars were registered to the passports. Then with armed, and often intimidating, Iranians in the first and last car, the tourists in the middle, they would head off, through Austria, across the lengths of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to Istanbul, then through the wilds of Eastern Turkey into Iran. The caravans drove almost non stop, ONE hour for sleep each day if you were lucky, on a five day whirlwind. The real adventure was the passage through eastern turkey, hoping you dogged the armed groups trying to secure the prize. Then the customary intense arguments over pay at the Iranian Border. You had to get paid <b>before</b> you crossed into Iran or you didn't get paid. The car was legally yours until you got into Iran. The intimidation to try to get you across the border and then stiff you was always intense.</p>
<P align=center>I made five or six trips. It was by this time mid summer, and I was still trying to figure out how to get back to the US so I could return and finish my degree at college, when an "opportunity" presented itself. A Syrian was putting together a crew to deliver trucks to the Syrian army in Beruit and was paying a bonus. I came up with probably the most stupid plan I have ever formulated. Bricks of Hash were going so cheap in Lebanon, I would just get one, bring it back and sell it to the tourists in Germany to fund the plane ticket (real smart).</p>
	<P align=center>I arrived in Beirut in the middle of the Civil war. Everything was blown to bits. It was hard to miss the bullet holes in the taxi cab doors and the blood stains on the floor as I rode to downtown Beruit. I checked into an older Run Down Motel. I didn't really consider
<P align=center>.....fleeing from Beruit......</P>
<P align=center>I climbed out of the cheroot just outside of Damascus and fell 
to the roadway as it took off. Things had started to get really bad. Projectile 
vomiting, uncontrollable diarrhea, severe dehydration, unable hold water down, 
extreme fever, and severely blurred vision that made all but the general landscape unrecognizable... I was at times unable to stand, falling and  getting up repeatedly. I was broke, sick, without any goods except the clothes on my back 
and my passport as I began to try to hitchhike my way out of Syria.</P>

<P class=Bible align=Center>
Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him.
And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;
but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p>
