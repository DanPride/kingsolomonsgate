	<H1 align=center>Near Death on the Road to Damascus</H1>
	<p align=center>JugenGastHaus Munich</p>
	<P align=center>
		Early August 1977<br>Six Years after King Solomon's Gate
	</P>
	<P align=center>Finally made it back. My fifth or sixth time I
		think, what a crazy way to live. The Wild Man New Zealand Chess Champ
		(Murray Chandler I think) and I were working as Drivers for Iranian
		entrepreneurs driving new cars from Munich to Iran. In the early 70's
		the money had just started to flow, the scene at the other end was a
		once in a lifetime deal. Then there was always the wild train ride
		back from Teheran through rural Iran and Eastern Turkey, and usually a
		hippie bus back to Munich from Istanbul. The Shah was still in power.
		I had my crew from the International Jugen Gast Haus (International
		Youth Hostel), Reiner the bavarian aristocrat doing his bit as a
		conscientious objector, his Canadian girlfriend Gail, and Werner, Peter...
		and names I now forget but whose memory I will always cherish. Murray
		was always out on the town. There were evenings when you could tell
		you were near him by the sound of the crowd as you walked down the
		Marienplatz. We'd meet up at the train station every day, the train
		station cafe was the business shop for the drivers. It was where you
		made your deals.</p>
	<p align=center>It was always fun to get back and tell the tales of
		the road,... which were always plentiful. The highlight this time has
		been the Turk on the train (local stopped in every village). He sat
		there for a half a day while we rode through the wilds of Turkey
		smoking hashish in a billowing cloud that rolled down the train,
		giving us love eyes. There was no law in eastern turkey, but I was
		clean anyway. Murray had produced this huge brick of hash just after
		we boarded in Teheran. I couldn't believe it. It didn't seem smart to
		me, but I was clean, I had nothing on me. I was happy to smoke his.
		The risk of both carrying it and smelling up the whole train seemed
		off the charts, but that was Murray. When he told me what it had cost
		him, and what it would sell for in Germany I quickly understood, at
		least the smuggling part. Finally after hours of the love eyes the
		turk had unzipped, did the wild thing while looking straight at Murray
		the whole time, re-zipped and got off the train at the next stop. We
		were rolling in isles in laughter for hours over it afterward.</p>
	<p align=center>Reiner loved the story, Gail did too through an
		obvious very red blush. Gail popped up with a "from now on I'm going
		to call you Gandolf" ? Who's that I asked. "A character from a book"
		she replied. Whats its about I asked? "Read the Book"" she answered
		and told me the name of the Book was called the Hobbit. Is it good or
		bad I asked. "Read the Book" she kept answering. I finally did get her
		to tell me it was about someone who was always going off on
		adventures. OK. That did sound kind of interesting.</p>
	<p align=center>But I had failed to do what I needed to do, raise
		enough money to get back to the states and finish college like my
		parents wanted. Gail, looking concerned asked what would I do? Do it
		again I answered with some hesitation, the plan, the murray solution
		was already starting to take shape in my head. it was August and I
		needed to get back SOON. But tonight was for friends, we went to
		Peters flat and out to the Marienplatz for beers. Then I saw Murray
		for the last time, walking down a side-street with some 30 people
		trailing behind him to see what he would do next. The crowd included a
		couple of very mean looking polizei who were taking an active
		interest. Murray didn't show up at the station the next day, and
		curiously as I write this I am waiting on his response to my facebook
		link to find out what happened :) (2014) I have been looking for him
		for years, and having stumbled upon him this weekend decided now was a
		good time to finish this.</p>
	<P align=center>
		The business always started at the Munich Train station. Iranians
		hanging in the cafe recruited drivers with western passports to form
		caravans of five or six brand new Peugeots. The cars were registered
		to the passports. Then with armed, and often intimidating, Iranians in
		the first and last car, the tourists in the middle, they would head
		off, through Austria, across the lengths of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to
		Istanbul, then through the wilds of Eastern Turkey into Iran. The
		caravans drove almost non stop, ONE hour for sleep each day if you
		were lucky, on a five day whirlwind. The real adventure was the
		passage through eastern turkey, hoping you dogged the armed groups
		trying to secure the prize. Then the customary intense arguments over
		pay at the Iranian Border. You had to get paid <b>before</b> you
		crossed into Iran or you didn't get paid. The car was legally yours
		until you got into Iran. The intimidation to try to get you across the
		border and then stiff you was always intense.
	</p>
	<P align=center>I made five or six trips. It was by this time mid
		summer, and I was still trying to figure out how to get back to the US
		so I could return and finish my degree at college, when an
		"opportunity" presented itself. A Syrian was putting together a crew
		to deliver trucks (it turns out) to the Syrian army in Beirut and was
		paying a bonus. I came up with probably the most stupid plan I have
		ever formulated. Bricks of Hash were going so cheap in Lebanon, I
		would just get one, bring it back and sell it to the tourists in
		Germany to fund the plane ticket (real smart). Hey Murray did it and
		it worked.</p>
	<P align=center>Turns out I am just riding. Driver is a really
		tough looking Syrian guy who doesn't speak english, and is short on
		manners. Long five days, too valuable a cargo, driver insists on
		windows down to keep him awake, almost non stop. Guns out at the
		stops. I arrived in Beirut in the middle of the Civil war. Everything
		was blown to bits. Had to jump from the truck cab at the border but
		they paid up real quick. It was hard to miss the bullet holes in the
		taxi cab doors and the blood stains on the floor as I rode to downtown
		Beirut. Completely exhausted and without thinking, I checked into an
		older Run Down Motel. I didn't really consider it was the one of the
		few non bombed out buildings on the street. I just wanted sleep. I do
		remember noticing the Holiday Inn a mile down the valley between the
		two sides sticking up like the lone structure it had become in No Mans
		land,... the valley where I decided to rest my head.</p>
	<P align=center>I got a good nights sleep and rose to a fine sunny
		Beirut morning in the rubble. I started out to explore the city, how
		does one connect in Beirut. I went to the Beach. Very fun, hooked up
		effortlessly with about a half a dozen guys on the beach smoking
		openly. I hoped in their car. One had a cross so I figured I was fine.
		We rode up a hill then past double double parked cars leaving a single
		lane with guys standing there, to a block or two later where two guys
		open the way by moving a vehicle. Then we pass. Sometimes you just got
		to go with the flow.</p>
	<P align=center>
		The car pulled up in front of a low two story deal and everybody got
		out and we walked up the stairs to a dimly lit storage room. Casual
		banter about how I should do it to succeed, tricks of the trade, short
		conversation I do not remember. My eyes begin to focus and I began to
		notice the rooms heavy wooden boxes were ammo, grenades, bazookas etc
		samples of which littered everywhere around me. then seeing a cross to
		my relief, on the man who had brought me,.. I blurt out in relief to
		the guy behind the boxes of ammo,... "so your Christian". I wanted to
		hear what he thought. He replied "no I'm moslem" and I did not hide my
		sudden rush of fear very well, Then the guy with the cross, who had
		brought me, interjected,... no no no you don't have anything to worry
		about. "<b>I</b> am christian, we were friends before the war and I am
		visiting. If trouble breaks out they would get us back to our side,
		but then the rule is enemies again at war once I have been returned".
		The guy sitting behind a stack of boxes of grenades, the one whom I
		had handed my money over to smiled, laughed, took a deep drag off his
		butt and threw to paper wrapped brick of hash over to me. We smiled,
		we all had a good laugh, even if mine probably sounded a bit tense.
	</p>
	<P align=center>But it was all fine. They were really decent folk
		from my experience, caught in extraordinary circumstance. They could
		have just as well have dumped me in a ditch, but they gave me and my
		brick a ride back to the beach with a fond farewell. With the years of
		fighting in front of them, I wonder how they each came out, but of
		course will never know.</p>
	<P align=center>The infamous plan of stupidity was progressing just
		fine so far. I made my way back to the old stately hotel, and upon
		arriving in the large 4 bed room, empty for the moment, I decided to
		stash my find underneath an old heavy Oaken Hat rack. Then I proceeded
		out on the town for dinner, and began planning my transit in my mind
		back to Munich.</p>
	<P align=center>I had a fine dinner in a local shop with a little
		more ouzo than would be prudent under the circumstances, and headed
		back without a care to my room and my brick. Along the way I came
		across a stall selling books, and low and behold the hobbit was among
		them so I bought it and stuck it under my arm. As I crossed through an
		alley to my great surprise I found myself suddenly up against a brick
		wall, with about a half dozen guns pointed at my face while several
		ran through my pockets emptying them. They were gone with a laugh and
		crude gestures and my pockets were empty. They got it all. All I had
		left was my brick, five lira in the backpack that I would discover
		later, my passport,... and they left me the hobbit too.</p>
	<P align=center>By now I knew I was in a fix. Time to go back to
		the room, a quiet place, sort it out, make a plan. Upon arriving I
		threw the brick on the bed, broke out the brick and had at it. As I
		was starting to relax on the bedside I picked up the book and began to
		scan it for signs of my character. Gandolf was of course on almost
		every page. So I leaned back to relax and begin a read. Some where in
		the early chapters I began to notice first one, then more and more
		loud booms in the distance. They kept getting closer. By dawn they
		were all around, and I was hiding under the bed as shots ricocheted
		off surrounding buildings. This went on with varying intensity for
		three days.</p>
	<P align=center>No TV. No Radio. No Company. Just Me, the brick,
		the book, and the explosions. Even mortars get boring after a few
		days. But the book was great. It created an atmosphere in my mind
		where this all seemed almost normal. The book had Orcs. I had muslim
		militia who would kill me in a moment if they knew I were close by,
		and I was close by, but so far they didn't know it.</p>
	<P align=center>The hotel was mostly Saudi's with their flowing
		silk robes. Why anybody stayed there is anybody's guess. It was a half
		a mile up the valley directly from the standing skeleton of the
		Holiday Inn High-rise. A vista made famous by Time Magazine numerous
		times in those years. The valley was no mans land. Where Moslem met
		Christian in holy battle week after weary week. This week, my week, it
		was a real hot spot. By dawn of the first day, as Bilbo dealt with the
		trolls, people were running up and down the street outside my window
		throwing grenades and exchanging gunfire. Some rich guy with flowing
		robes opened my door unannounced and laughed at me hiding under the
		bed with the book. Just then a string of bullets struck the wall and
		the lord of all creation did a quick belly flop on the floor, as I
		laughed right back at him. He quickly arose with a harumpf and left. I
		spent the next few hours hiding behind the water heater in the
		bathroom, fearful the dissed one would tip the militia surrounding the
		hotel as to the easy prize within. But nothing happened. The fighting
		raged outside for a full three days before it subsided,.. and now
		famished, I chanced to emerge.</p>
	<P align=center>I remember walking down the long stairway
		overlooking the lobby, with its black and white diamond tiles, and
		whirring ceiling fan et al, all straight out of a casa blanca set, and
		asking timidly if it was safe yet. The clerk assured me with a wave,
		it was all over for now. He directed me toward the embassy at my
		request. I arrived frantic, blurting out to the woman behind the
		counter, "what in hell is going on ?". She pursed her lips and said it
		was nothing to worry about, simply an organizational dispute. "Lady I
		am not up on the hill, I am staying in the valley". She pursed her
		lips again and in a monotone said "We advise you to leave that Area
		Immediately". Great,... HOW do I get out of here". To which she
		replied that there was fighting on the North Road but that the Road to
		Damascus was clear.</P>
	<P align=center>I arrived back at the Hotel in a state of
		exasperation, no money, just the hash. My stomach was doing flip
		flops. During the 3 days I had to drink the Beirut Tap Water. A
		Volcano was beginning to emerge rapidly from within. How much worse
		could it get I thought as I climbed the steps to the Hotel Lobby.</p>
	<P align=center>As I started up the stairs to the Room the clerk
		yelled and brought me up short. He said I wasn't living up there
		anymore, Palestinians had checked in and they moved me down behind the
		Desk for my safety. I'll make sure you didn't forget anything I stated
		and against his protest continued up to the Room. The furniture had
		all been rearranged to make way for more beds, but then right in the
		middle of the Room was the HatRack. With My Brick now open and lying
		on top of its base. I spun on my heel and went back downstairs saying
		Yes he had gotten everything. And then inquired about where to eat and
		he directs me to the cafe at the base of the stairs, he didn't really
		want me to go. I flew down the stairs out the door and down the street
		to the Market. I have five in coins. The Cheroots were asking six.
		Again and again, the driver of the small toyota pickup truck had five
		passengers for Damascus. He Kept yelling, then finally with a toss of
		his head took my five the pointed me to the truck.</P>
	<P align=center>I climbed out of the cheroot just outside of
		Damascus and fell to the roadway as it took off. Things had started to
		get really bad. Projectile vomiting, uncontrollable diarrhea, severe
		dehydration, unable hold water down, extreme fever, and severely
		blurred vision that made all but the general landscape
		unrecognizable... I was at times unable to stand, falling and getting
		up repeatedly. I was broke, sick, without any goods except the clothes
		on my back and my passport as I began to try to hitchhike my way out
		of Syria.</P>
	<P class=Bible align=Center>Managed to get as far a the Syrian
		border crossing. But was really delirious by then. Standing there with
		my thumb out, an English Driver who had been delivering Oil Pipe to
		Saudi and was on his way back recognized me from the coffee shops on
		the route and picked me up. He got me a pail of Yogurt, it was a
		teaspoon at a time to start to see if it would stay down. But it
		worked. I made it back to Munich, and it was Reinhart's salon in the
		parlor again with select and cherished guests. Gail asked what I would
		do now,.. and dropped her Jaw when I replied, I was going to do it
		again and make it work this time. I didn't see that I had a choice.</p>
	<P class=Bible align=Center>The next morning Gail presented me with
		a ticket to NYC. All the crew had chipped in and Gail had found a
		super deal out of Luxembourg. I arrived at New York customs nearly
		barefoot, with the military sleeping role and my passport and the
		clothes on my back my only possessions. The Customs officer without
		looking up asked me in a mechanical voice if I had in excess of 25000
		in cash or securities on me. I laughed until I collapsed on the floor
		in tears as he answered for me "I guess not". By arriving at JFK I had
		completed my trip around the world.</p>
	<P class=Bible align=Center>I had everything but the booming voice
		on this one.</p>
	<P class=Bible align=Center>Now as he journeyed he approached
		Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he
		fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why
		do you persecute me?" And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said,
		"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city,
		and you will be told what you are to do." The men who were traveling
		with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. Saul
		arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see
		nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
		And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p>
