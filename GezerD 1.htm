	<p>Dear Librarian
	<p>
		<br>
	<p>Enclosed please find a copy of the records of the Tel Gezer
		Archaeological excavations conducted by Hebrew Union College which I
		wish to donate to the Pelletier Library.
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>Allegheny College was a participant in these Biblical
		excavations at Tel Gezer Israel in 1971 and 1973. Dig photos included
		in these volumes include photo's of Don Hobson, at the time the
		Allegheny College Chaplin as well as other Alleghenians
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>Recent documentaries aired on the History Channel (Digging for
		Truth) credit this excavation (and the efforts of an Allegheny
		Volunteer) with the historic first proof of a Biblical passage. This
		viewpoint is now widely accepted by most mainstream archaeologists.
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>The Solomonic Gate excavation is documented in these volumes.
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>I hope you, or your Religion/Ancient History departments can
		find a use for these historic documents.
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>Dan Pride
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>P.S. The schematics and drawings go into the pouch of the larger
		volume, I packed them loose so they fit into the box.
