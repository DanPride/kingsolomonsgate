		<b>Cotton fire at Woody's</b>
	</p>
	<P align=center>It had been three years of waiting and now there
		would be no trial. For three years I had assumed stupidity, the
		thought that the government would be involved just seemed to remote to
		even consider despite the gathering evidence. In disgust I had spent
		the day searching the web, reading sites that seemed credible and all
		proposed radically different views of what was going on at the highest
		levels. The blinders were coming off. They had to know, and if they
		knew the truth, that meant they were behind it in some way.
		Disturbing, unnerving as it was... the conclusion had become
		inescapable.</P>
	<P align=center>Deeply troubled by the prospect I went to lunch to
		escape the thought. The restaurant was empty and I sat chatting with
		Woody as the television news began to discuss a Government
		Whistleblower's story. It was too much. I looked at my friend Woody
		and blurted out. "Don't believe it for a minute... you just can't
		trust those m*therf**kers as far as you can throw em". (by which I
		meant Federal Law Enforcement).</P>
	<P align=center>At that precise moment an truly extraordinary thing
		happened.</P>
	<P align=center>Behind Woody an extraordinary burst of bright white
		light exploded into the room. A blindingly bright oval orb a foot and
		a half in diameter composed of a sparkling silver lattice, appeared from nowhere in mid air in the room and
		burned with the crackle of an old time camera flash bulb. It bathed
		the entire room just as a flash cube would have but even more so, much
		more so and much longer. In a few seconds it was gone leaving a
		rapidly fading pentagonal framework of a golden honeycomb structure dissolving into golden drops as
		it disappeared.</P>
	<P align=center>Woody wheeled around with a startled cry to see
		nothing and no one left behind. As I looked around and out the window
		in Astonishment, I saw three people at the road 100 feet away on a
		bright sunny colorado day, conversing agitatedly and pointing in our
		direction.</P>
	<br>
	<br>
	<P class="bible" align=center>And the angel of the Lord appeared
		unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked,
		and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>

		<b>Documentary Sources:</b> Unfortunately Woody had a stroke two years
		later and may have no recall now (unknown). My only source for the
		"Burning Bush" if Woody hasn't recovered, is a friend with whom I ate
		there regularly. <a href="http://www.getfirefly.net/">James
			Johnson</a> discussed the event with myself and Woody on two occasions
		over Moo Gatiem and he is my only documentary source. Woody also
		discussed it with staff but I have no idea who they were. He may also
		have mentioned it to family members (unknown).
