<P class=intro align=left><i>Note: The Green murder was never solved, however I believe to this day that it was caused by her central role in the Welfare Motel scandal. Reports indicated that her head was found in the laundry basket, all but totally separated from her body. A parallel to John the Baptist. I wonder if she was threatening to do the right thing,... guess we will never know, but I would like to think so, she was known as that type of person.</i></p>

HEADLINE: Dorchester victim may have let in her killer<br>
<br>
BYLINE: By Sean Murphy, Globe Staff<br>
</p><P class=intro align=center>
BODY:
Authorities believe the Dorchester woman who was
killed in her home Saturday evening probably fell
victim to an assailant she knew and trusted.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Eileen M. Green, 46, a social worker with the state
Department of Social Services, was found stabbed to
death in the den.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Green died of multiple stab wounds in the back of her
neck, according to Leonard Atkins, assistant state
medical examiner. 
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Police said the wounds apparently were inflicted with
a heavy, bladed instrument, possibly a machete, which
left deep lacerations along a 5-inch area at the base
of her skull.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
No weapon was found at the scene.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Kenneth Green, 27, found his mother's body at about 6
p.m. on Saturday. Police said Green was lying face
down under a pile of her clothes in the Milton Avenue
house.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
The duplex-styled house is a short distance from
Gallivan Boulevard in the Lower Mills section of
Dorchester.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Kenneth Green and his sister, April, 28, declined to
comment yesterday afternoon.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Authorities have ruled out sexual assault and robbery
as a possible motive in the killing, a police source
said. Green apparently let her assailant into the
first-floor apartment on Saturday afternoon. Neighbors
reported no unusual activities or people in the
neighborhood on Saturday.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Police last night were attempting to locate a man
believed to have been a guest at Green's home on
Saturday.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
"She was a loving, caring person," said Sylvia Jones,
Green's twin sister. "She especially loved children
and worked with abused children for the state."
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Jones said her sister was active in housing, education
and employment issues in her Dorchester neighborhood.
"She was the kind of person who was always interested
in making the community a better place to live in."
</p><P class=intro align=center>
"We have to accept that she is gone," Jones said.
"Nothing is going to bring her back."
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Green, a widow, lived with April and her grandson,
Timothy, 7. Jones said her sister grew up in
Dorchester in a family of eight children and attended
public schools before marrying. She attended
Northeastern University and began work for the state
several years ago, she said.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Eileen Green maintained an office at the Solomon
Carter Fuller Mental Health Center in the South End,
but devoted most of her hours to casework. Her primary
responsibility was to check on the welfare of children
reportedly abused by parents in sections of Roxbury
and Dorchester.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Green was the 16th murder victim reported in Boston
this year. Homicide detectives are still appealing to
the public for information relating to last week's
slaying of a Beacon Hill store clerk.
</p><P class=intro align=center>
Naveen Giri, 22, a Nepalese aviation student, was
stabbed to death at about 7 p.m. on Feb. 19 while
working at Mrs. Fields, a cookie store on Charles
Street.
