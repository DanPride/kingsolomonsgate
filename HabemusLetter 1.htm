Dear Dr Mario</p>
<P>
 Thank you so much for your prior assistance in obtaining the Vatican Video.
You can see the result at...</p>
<P>
http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/HabemusPapem.htm</p>
<P>
I was hoping you could also be of assistance in a related matter.</p>
<P>
I would like to contact someone who is in contact with, or can talk
with, Mehmet Ali Agca. I believe I was one of his victims shortly
before he shot John Paul and I would like to get him to confirm it.</p>
<P>
I have posted a story about this at</p>
<P>
http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/MoneyChanger.htm</p>
<P>
I would like someone to ask him if he remembers breaking the hand of a
tourist in the courtyard of the Ayosofya two years before he shot John
Paul, and to let me know if he answers it. I believe it was part of a
series of Grey Wolf crimes at the time. There are a number of pictures
of me on the web site which may be of help as they are pretty
contemporary to the events (See Eleven Regrets).</p>
<P>
Any assistance you could be in this effort would be greatly
appreciated. Perhaps you could point me in the right direction. I
believe I would do better at this going through someone in the Church
rather than via the Turkish authorities.</p>
<P>
Any help you can be would be again greatly appreciated.</p>
<P>
Bless you and Thanks for your help with the Habemus Papem Video.</p>
Sincerely,<BR>
Dan Pride</p>
