		Original Letter to the District Attorneys office<br> August 18,
		2006
	</H1>
	<P class=Intro align=center>
		To whom it may concern: I was on the 12.30 am bus from Boulder to
		Denver on Christmas night. I had spent the day with a friend and
		family, James "Mac" Read of Longmont Colorado. The nine ocklock bus
		did not show that night and the midnight greyhound was late. It
		arrived about 12.30 or so. Just a minute or two before it <b>left*</b>
		Karr showed up standing on the platform near the the bus. I think he
		was wearing a western type fleece vest (brown outside white fluff
		inside). I tried to bum a light for a cigarette from him and he
		freaked out as I approached with an "ohhhhhh noooooo". He got on the
		bus and sat on the right side about a quarter the way back on the
		right side (facing with the bus). He kept looking over his shoulder at
		me sitting on the left side about half way back. Really kind of
		freaked me out at the time. He got off at the second stop which I
		believe was the highway. Why? I haven't a clue, on the surface it
		doesnt seem to make sense, however he was quite noticible and you
		should try to locate anyone else who was on the bus that night. My ID
		is not 100% but its about 90%. As a witness I have credibility
		problems up the ying, I believe you would not want me involved.
		However with all the attention you should be able to locate others on
		the bus that night... it was packed.
	</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>If I can be of help of course I would
		be will to, but as I said you will be better off with another source.

		<b>Correction:</b> The bus must have left right at one ocklock, it
		arrived and departed late. The figure arrived at the bus just a minute
		or two before departure. I missed the connecting bus out Aurora Ave,
		the Denver Bus system stopped running at 2.00
	</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>
		<b>Credibility Issues:</b> My reference to "Credibility issues" was a
		reference to this site. While every single word is correct and true
		and the events have happened exactly as described, it is of course a
		defense lawyers dream. A prosecutor would have to spend extensive
		effort to prove every word and then by the time he got done defending
		his witness and proving the credibility, the focus of the trial would
		be lost
