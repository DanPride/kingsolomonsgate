<H1 align=center><br>The First Call to the Feds to turn in "Their Man"</H1><br>
<p class=story>
Now this was the life. The work all done, time to play for a month and wait for the contract, the checks and the Money. For almost two years I had slaved over that piece of software. It was light years ahead of the competitition. Any luck and it should make a fortune. Just a few more weeks and a few well placed calls and I would Join the ranks of the california entrepreneurs. The installer did most of the selling. Easy street was around the corner... I could feel it.
</p><p class=story>
It had been a beautiful day. sun surf and women all over the resort. As the sun went down and darkness fell, campfire sprang up around the resort and the evening parties commenced. I decided to go visiting</p>
<p class=story>I cruised the backside of the resort and stopped at a campfire of a guy named Whitely who I had just met. Whitey appeared to live out of the back of a station wagon, but tonight he had some distinguished company.... an established oracle software developer who knew the Silicon Valley software market like the back of his hand. They were engaged in a lively discussion about the bomber guy who was threatening air traffic across California. A discussion of the intracacies of software marketing in the Valley seemed out of the question, so I Listened to the Discussion. The Million Dollar reward, the threat to pubic safety or something had gotten Whitey's fire up. He had become a walking encyclopedia of the case. As he talked on I listened, some of the stuff he was saying started to have a 
familiar ring. I started to take an interest in the conversation. As Whitey talked on into the night, I remembered a conversation I had had with Doug Gondor several years earlier. We were sitting outside the Saratoga coffee shop, reading papers when Doug sat up with a start and laughed. Hey check this out he said pointing at a sketch of the Unabomber in the paper that day. "My god doesn't that look like Ray?" he exclaimed with a laugh. "Hey what if Ray really was the Unabomber" he giggled. Wouldn't that be far out he laughed again. "But look... it really does look like Ray"! "Yea Right" I replied... "we will split the million and live happily ever after".  I had to admitt there was a strong resemblance but the possibility seemed too remote to take seriously. It was a cold chilly day. We were sitting outside, and I wanted to be about our business.</p>
<p class=story>
Now in the light of the campfire I daydreamed briefly about the million dollar reward as one daydreams abut winning the lottery (or at least I do. Everything Whitey was saying seemed to be describing Ray. Thats really strange I thought... remembering Dougs reaction again.</p>
<p class=story>
As I left, I commented to Whitey...."Ya know, I may just know this guy". I think I will call them and give it a shot. Hell I laughed... "This one doesn't even cost a buck".</p>
<p class=story>The next morning after some difficulty getting the number, I made my first call to the FBI from a Pay phone at the Read White and Blue... without a stitch". "FBI Hotline" and important sounding voice answered. "Hey I think this is probably a waste of your time but I have a possible lead for you" I said. I recounted some of the things Whitey had covered the night before, and added... and he really does look like the sketch.</p>
<p class=story>"Its probably a waste of your time, but I thought I would call it in anyways". They cordially thanked me and I hung up feeling a little foolish. My God here I was calling the FBI from a pay phone at a nudist resort with my dongle hanging out. It was so ridiculous it was sublime I laughed to myself, as I hit the beach for another glorious day of California sun,</p>
<p class=story>My curiosity had been aroused however. Over the next few days I Started to follow the case in the Newspaper, and More details seemed to fit. On the day the Manifesto was published I went to town to specifically locate the article. It was not in the local paper so I debated with myself about spending the extra money for the New York Times. I hadn't closed the deal yet and money was extraordinarily tight.</p>
<p class=story>The Question resolved itself. As I was walking back past the Newstand boxes someone had placed a New York Times on top of the box. "Hot Dam" A freebie I thought suspecting nothing more than good luck. As I stood there reading the excerpts my jaw dropped in consternation. I could hear Rays voice in my head as I read the passages. The writer had done a marvelous job, it was simply a list of Rays greatest quotes.. I was shocked. I was dumbfounded. I was confused. I tried to call from a pay phone on the street but it was too noisy. so I drove back to the Red White and Blue beach (nudist resort). My heart was racing. The flush of panic rose with every mile as I drove up the costal highway. Oh my GOD ! someone I know is about to blow up an airliner and kill a bunch of people. Good God, Jesus Christ.... Holy Shit !!!!
</p>
<p class=story>Incredibley, Unbelievably, someone was using the phone... and a  girl was waiting ahead of me. The guy went on forever about some mundane business deal and the girl would not let me go ahead. Visions of some crowded plane warming up on the runway with a bomb on board danced in my head.  The girl seemed a loonie. She ranted on and on trying to turn someone in for something, all the while ranting on repeating herself semi-coherently. She finally got off the phone. I dialed the hotline number in a panic... fingers shaking as I pushed the buttons.</p>
<p class=story>
"FBI Hotline" The important voice answered. "Hi 09264 calling. I have some important information."  "OK OK what is it". "I Know who it is". "Really, the voice answered somewhat skeptical. I recognize the document (Manifesto). I have read it before. I read it on Dettling's computer".</p>
<p class=story>Oh really, the voice answered now completely skeptical. "Who's Dettling". "Dettling.... you know ..... the guy I called about before? "Don't you guys link up the information I asked somewhat incredulous. Aren't you computerized?" I asked my panic level still rising.... "Well, Thank you for calling" we will check into it".... have a good day she said curtley and hung up.</p>
<p class=story>I was stunned. My first thought was "this maniac is about to murder a couple hundred people and I got a Ditz on  the phone". Realizing that I needed to plan my next move a little better and calm down, I walked back to the camp site to sort things out and tell Frank and Mary about the incredible developments.
