	<H1 align=center>Courtney's Courtly Love, Cobain's Dance</H1>
	<P class=intro align=center>
		Soho District,<BR> New York City<BR> 1990's
	</p>
	<br>
	<P class=intro align=center>Courtney Loves band was playing
		Bunrattys for three days. As I entered the bar the first day She
		walked up to me and introduced herself. "Hi I'm Courtney... Courtney
		Love" she said suggestively cupping her hand toward her breast as she
		said it. I immediately replied "Is that anything like Courtley Love?"</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I was immediately smitten and spent
		much of the next three days with her flirting and trying my best. and
		learning of the problems a broken jaw can present one with. Contrary
		to the publicity she recieved much later, the Courtney I knew was a
		sweet and dear person. Witty, fun and very sexy. But then she was gone
		on her way, three nights in the thousand nights I spent in the Boston
		Heavy Metal scene.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>The Scene itself also came and went as
		did I. I Eventually arrived in New York City to work as a programmer
		for RCA Records. Altho I had nothing to do with "A+R" (getting people
		signed to a record deal), I found that those three letters on the
		Business Card and the thousand dollar Brooks Brother suits I was fond
		of wearing in those days,... did remarkable things for my New York
		night life.
	<P class=intro align=center>So it was that on an unusually self
		abusive night I wound up leaning against a wall in some loft in Soho
		while the new talent at RCA strutted its stuff for the industry
		insiders.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>Leaning against the wall in I must
		admitt a near stupor, this singer came walking down along the line of
		about thirty industry execs, pausing as he passed me. He Sang right at
		me to be noticed, I stirred, I looked up,... and managed an
		unsophisticated "Hey that's pretty good".</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>Cobain's face brightened in a wide
		smile and with a nod toward me he continued on down the line singing
		teen spirt as he went.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>The song of course was soon everywhere
		and then I knew who he was.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I listened and grew to appreciate his
		music and would occasionally catch glimpses of him in this or that
		media. I noted his suicide with a bit of disinterest until I suddenly
		became aware that Courtney had become his wife.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>It suddenly became personal. My
		attitude changed abruptly toward him.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>How could he be such an SOB as to do
		that to her?</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>Its the part of life the suiciders
		never see</p>
