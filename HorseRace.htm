Sixty six Bird Flu cases possible in some little
village in indonesia, cases poping up in pidgeons,
mink, cats,  and all,...  and six billion people
susceptible.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>
Too many people and not enough needles I guess.<br>

Shares of Carrington Laboratories (CARN:Nasdaq) were skyrocketing after the company
said its DelSite Biotechnologies unit selected Invitrogen's
(IVGN:Nasdaq) PD-Direct services to develop a process for
a cell-based avian H5 influenza antigen that will be
used in a nasal vaccine.</p>
<P class=ref align=center>
DelSite is developing a nasal powder vaccine for
pandemic avian influenza that combines its GelVac vaccine delivery
system with an avian H5 influenza whole virion antigen. Carrington, a
biopharmaceutical company, was jumping $1.79, or
39.5%, to $6.34.</i></p>

The Bird Flu sounds like the start of Armageddon to me. One of those "be very prepared and a little lucky to survive it".
Carrington Labs has 26 patents on snortable H5N1 vaccines. Once this
thing hits there are not going to be enough needles and the injection process seems too cumbersome anyway.
Mass mailing a powder you just snort makes more sense to me.
They are a small cap of 50
million. When they have the rights to six BILLION vacine shots and
that is all that there is between humanity and oblivion,... but I am a programer not a financial analyst. The day they
announce the pandemic I can imagine a hundred to one run, nice fantasy anyway eh?. Maybe not.

Buying it provides funds to one of the only available solutions early. Buying it seems like a good thing to do.
It is weird to own tho. Every time it goes up you are happy to make the
money and that much more fightened by the approach of so much death,
possibly including your own. A simultaneous WOW and YIKES. Very wierd.<br>

<P class=intro align=center>This Company may well be the only hope for tens of millions of human beings if these warning by experts are correct. ...sound's like buy stock, make lots of money, and save the world! If only the sixties could be as clear :)
