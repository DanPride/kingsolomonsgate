	</p>
	<br>

	<P class=intro align=center>It started with a prophetic dream. A
		dream of me... standing in St Peters Square with a flock of several
		dozens of birds flying around my head in a tight 30 foot circle, just
		like what had actually happened Piza two years earlier as I made my
		way to Vatican City for the first time. But in the dream the birds
		were anointing me Pope.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>An odd dream for a former Lutheran.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>Most of my dreams are forgotten by
		noon. Not this one. I could not get it out of my head. It became a
		daydream of the glories of papal infallibility, what great things for
		the world a pope could do. Population control, distribution of income,
		help for the poor... the things you could do for the world by just
		declaring them seemed endless. Absurd of course.... but a nice fantasy
		nonetheless. Geez and that great apartment and rent free ! :)</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>Still, even without the fantasy, the
		dream kept replaying in my head. What did it mean. I had had an odd
		feeling visiting the Vatican two years before. Standing in St Peters
		square if felt somehow like it was mine, or like I somehow belonged
		there. I watched as John Paul's health failed and found myself
		repeatedly checking the price of flights to Rome from Minneapolis. I
		started to think about moving there, but the thought of going
		someplace cool to wait for someone to die seemed unseemly so I put it
		out of my mind.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>
		When John Paul died I watched the overwhelming crowds and was thankful
		I had resisted the urge to go, but at the same time was overtaken by a
		feeling of near panic. I was going to miss something important.
		Somehow it seemed like I was supposed to be there. I listened to the
		TV talk about a <i>Revelations event which had been prophesied for
			a thousand years to happen at this election</i>, and wondered what it
		would be.
	</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>As the funeral came to a close I
		decided to throw all caution and financial prudence to the wind and
		go. I rationalized it to myself by saying there was so much of Rome I
		had not yet seen,... the time would not be wasted.</P>
	<P class=intro align=center>It would be exciting to be witnessing
		history, but there was also this expectancy, somehow something
		interesting was going to happen, I was sure of it ...but what could it
		be?</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I arrived in Rome two days before the
		conclave and began spending the days in St Peters square. One of the
		crowd awaiting the white smoke.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I sat and read biblical passages,
		talked with all manner of people and awaited the event that was sure
		to come.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I read Ezekiel the first day, John the
		next morning, and in the afternoon switch to Revelations Ten. I had
		just completed the passage leading to the End of times events...</p>
	<P class=bible align=center>
		<i> Then the Angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land
			lifted his hand heavenward and swore by Him who lives for ever and
			ever, who created the heaven and what it contains, also the earth and
			what is in it, and the sea with everything in it, "There shall be no
			further delay; but in the days of the seventh Angel's trumpet blast,
			when he is at the point of blowing it, the mystery of God will reach
			completion in agreement with the good news He gave His servants the
			prophets." 
	</P>
	<P class=bible align=center>Then the voice from heaven which I
		heard addressed me again and said, "Go and take the little, opened
		scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and
		on the land" So I went to the angel, asking him to give me the little
		scroll.</P>
	<P class=bible align=center>
		He told me, "Take and eat it! It will be bitter in your stomach, but
		in your mouth it will be sweet as honey". So I took the little scroll
		from the angels hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was as sweet as
		honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. </i>
	</P>
	<P class=intro align=center>
		I looked up at the chimney and noticed <a href="HabemusClip02.htm">a
			single bird landing on the pole above it,</a> <img src="images/video.gif">
		the smoke coming just as the bird touched down and then flew away. I
		instantly knew that it was what I had been waiting for. As others
		excitedly debated its color, somehow,... I already knew it was
		"blanco" and headed for the front seats. It seemed like a small thing
		to travel so far to see, but the moment I saw it I immediately related
		it to the dream. It started me walking toward the front.<a href="HabemusClip02.htm"><IMG align="Left"
			HSpace=20 VSpace=10 border=1 src="images/Bird_Tmb.jpg"></a>
	</P>
	<P class=intro align=center>Compared to the grandeur of the dream
		it seemed like a small scroll indeed, but it felt good somehow,
		somehow oddly satisfying.</P>
	<P class=intro align=center>As I waited for the announcement my
		stomach began to ache. Perhaps it was the subliminal suggestion of the
		passage, or maybe just the wild turkey and expresso I had before
		heading back into the square.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I watched the proceedings and left the
		square, unaware that as I stood there unconsciously stretching and
		rubbing my painful stomach, and then again as I applauded the
		announcement, my picture had been sent around the world on every
		channel... CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, Vatican TV etc etc etc.</P>
	<P class=intro align=center>They had announced the Pope, closed the
		book, and then it was my face flashed around the world... the camera
		transfixed for a long, strange, 12 second shot of me, singled out from
		a crowd of a half million...a long receding shot reminiscent of
		"Digging for the Truth", standing on the spot where Mehmet Ali Agca
		shot John Paul ... and only later the face of the designated pope.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>
		Meaning is a subtle thing, its easy to look for it, and see it where
		it may not be... but the events convinced me to continue writing these
		stories down as they happen. To keep recording for whoever has an
		interest,... what happened after the <a href="index.html">first
			proof of a biblical passage</a>. Perhaps I was meant to "continue
		prophesizing",... to be truthful,...
	</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>...it felt like a very private nod of approval.</P>
