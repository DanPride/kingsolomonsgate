		Yigael Yadin poses as HA-PA-KHERED, the child form of Horus, symbolic
		of rebirth, new day, new era, as the World's leading archaeological
		authorities look on. Dr William Dever, one of the photo's participants
		denies the similarity and indicates that Yadin was simply looking
		puzzled in what he believed was a 1967 National Geographic photo of
		field one.**<br>

	<p class="quote" align="center">It is my belief that this is an
		unspoken gesture by Yadin which Dever is missing. It is I believe an
		expression of his confidence that based on the dimensions in
		Macalister's records he knew what he was going to find here, and
		wanted the world to know that he clearly understood what it meant. It
		is an interesting and brilliant choice of symbols. The interpretation
		seems obvious, just like the identical crook in the finger poses...
	<p class="quote" align="center">Yadin, Commander of the Jerusalem
		Road battle during the 48 war, Excavator of Masada, Dead Sea Scroll
		Authority and purchaser of four the original seven scrolls (his father
		bought the other three), Excavator of Hazor,... considered Tel Gezer's
		Solomonic Gate to be the highpoint of his life and career. Sorry Dr
		Dever, but Yadin's got-cha on this one :) He is and always will be the
		Giant in the room.</p>


	<p class="quote" align="center">**based on personal conversations
		with Dever during the 2007 excavations at Tel Gezer. Dever has
		identified this as a field one photo from the National Geographic
		Magazine taken in 1967. I am still working to verify that, I have long
		believed (could be wishful thinking I guess) the photo is the
		Solomonic Gate from 1971 with me the figure in the background.</p>
