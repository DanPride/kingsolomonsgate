					Its "nice" that Q Todd rewrote the bylaws of the tiny Sigma Alfa
					Epsilon Fraternity, I had no idea MY complete rewrite of the
					Student Government bylaws (see at left) and its <a
						href="QTBylaws.htm">Student Body wide referendum</a> (which
					resulted in his second defeat in 1973) had such an exemplary
					impact. In fact I had entirely forgotten about it.

				<P class=banner align=center>
					At our 25th anniversary at Allegheny, as I shook his hand on the
					steps of Bentley Hall to congratulate him on his appointment by
					President Clinton, I said "See how much good it did ya to have <B>me</B>
					kick your ass twice. eh? eh? eh?" smile smile "<B>See...things
						always work out for the best in life</B>".
				</p>
				<P class=banner align=center>
					To see those comments, parroted here was stunning. After 30 years
					of looking in the mirror, perhaps I can be forgiven for wondering
					if at its root, it wasn't just a matter of a gay <B>Dick</b>inson's
					resentments at the college community he hid from while attempting
					to lead it and the added jealousy created by <b>what won't
						reach where :(</B>

				<P class=banner align=center>
					I guess all those <a href="QT/35.htm">whispered jokes</a> at
					Allegheny must have been true after all. <br> <img border="1"
