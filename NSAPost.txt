15 years ago a website was launched which discussed NSA crimes and surveillance.
It was dismissed as ridiculous by all.
It is still up, waiting for the world to catch up.

Now that Snowden has published, perhaps it is time for a second look.

Echelon, as the program was first named, required billions of 1980's and 90's dollars to build.

To support its funding it they engaged in a series of incredibly high profile terrorist actions and cloaked them
in a psyops campaign which was so powerful that when they closed the operation with an arrest
and public trial of the brainwashed patsy, everybody got a good laugh and walked away.

To this day, if you mention the case to anyone over 25, they are flooded with feelings of ridicule and absurdity.
To say the word is to define yourself as a nut.
It worked.

Don't let it work on you. Ignore those feelings and take a good look at the deep dark world
of the NSA as exposed on the site Unabombers.com
