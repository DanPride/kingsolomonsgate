		<b>Eleven Regrets<br> Guiding Lights in the Mysteries of the
			Universe
		</b>
	<P>Failing to get the college degree didn't seem to really matter
		all that much. After the years in south east Asia dealing with the
		flotsam and jetsam of the Killing Fields, it just didn't compute
		anymore. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon on the south side of
		Chicago. A gentle breeze, perfect weather, great rides and adventure.
		Hell, I'm not going to fight for the key to the executive john, I am
		either going to own it...or I am not going to worry about it, I told
		myself. My father had decided to start an auction business in Montana,
		and lacking any other great prospects it was time to go give it a try.
		I put a sign on my backpack that said "Montana or Bust", stuck out my
		thumb, and headed for Bozeman. It had been a fun trip so far and I was
		seeing country I had never seen before. Fresh air, freedom, and no
		judgments from kids without a clue.</P>
	<P>A yellow pickup truck pulled over some hundred feet down the
		road and I grabbed my pack and ran for it. I opened the door and hoped
		in. The truck started up as I closed the door. The door closed, the
		truck started, I turned my head, looked over, saw him, and smelt him
		all at the same time. It was like those dramatic bursts of music
		between the scenes in the movie Independence Day.</P>
	<P>He immediately started to speak at me as the smell sunk in. I
		had smelt it before on the borders of Cambodia but didn't put a name
		to it immediately. My body just knew this was big trouble, the hairs
		on my forearm stood straight up like a dog's neck bristles and without
		a cognitive thought my brain was racing like a siren. The smell lit up every circuit in my body,... just like its supposed to.</P>
	<P>I looked out the window at the shoulder of the road as it speed
		by, already considering a jump as he spoke at me. Hey why didn't I
		take a break and go with him, we'd have a party, and he would show me
		his handcuff trick that was so cool. I demurred and said I was going
		straight on through, I had to get there soon, I was going straight on
		through. He continued to talk. Did I know he was a good guy, yea he
		owned his own construction company, did I need work. He even helped
		with charity, yea, he dressed up like a clown sometimes and
		entertained kids. I didn't need to worry about him he instructed. Hell
		he was even into politics, a leader in his community. "You'll have a
		good time". "You'll see". That sickly sweet familiar smell kept
		wafting through my nostrils and panic created a clear focus and
		intent. Get away. Stay on the highway, lots of witnesses driving by.</P>
	<P>He then announced we were going to his place and started to veer
		off onto an off ramp. I stamped with my right foot as if I had a
		break. No No I have to go right on through I insisted as the truck
		began to cruise up the ramp. 50, 45 40 I watched the row of trees and
		beyond the low fence the long low set of brown grey tan buildings set
		back off to the right speed by as we climbed up the ramp. He wasn't
		really slowing down that much. I silently calculated my options and
		they all looked bad. I looked at him and they got worse...his arms
		were bigger around than my legs. If he got a hand on me...I watched
		the intersection come up, there was traffic and in its midst was
		someone who must have learned to drive in Boston. The truck jerked as
		he gassed and braked to dominate the car coming from the left. The man
		I owe the last 30 years and more would not give. I watched the
		pavement go by more slowly and looked back. The angel of my existence
		had forced the pickup truck straight across the median and now Gacy
		had won but had to make the left without his prey escaping. That Giant
		right arm swung over the steering wheel to make the 90 degree turn
		still going 20 at least. I lifted the door latch and fell like a sack
		of grain propelled by the turn, my pack dragging behind me and landed
		on the pavement ...a foot down, to my knees, then the hands scraping
		on the pavement, then flat on my side. "The mouths of the Lions were
		yet again sewn shut" (Daniel 6:22). The sound of the truck being
		floored filled my ears as I struggled to my feet and got the plate
		number.</P>
	<P>
		Wow, I got up and moved to the side of the road carrying my pack,
		completely stunned...I knew the smell but it would be a while before I
		put a label on the smell of death, the fear had made details
		irrelevant. I walked across the on ramp and put my pack down to try
		and collect my thoughts. Standing there with the green Kelty pack
		leaning against my legs, the "Montana or Bust" sign stuck in the
		spokes like a billboard. Then suddenly the thought... <I>what if
			he comes back for me</I>...I looked around for immediate options, having
		a plan ready could make all the difference, my brain again racing
		after 10 seconds of relief..
	</P>
	<P>
		At that moment fate took a hand. A small sports car roared up with a
		screech of breaks and some guy was demanding I get in, "come on, get
		in, get in, get in... the voice insisted. I glanced up quickly to see
		if the truck was in the oncoming line, looked down and jumped in. The
		driver began to explain, "I just got a fuzz buster and I am going to
		set a record to Billings, I can't believe you are going to Montana" he
		began to chatter. I interrupted, "Look something's happened, I got to
		have a pen, do you have a pen". He directed me to the glove box. <I>I
			wrote the plate number down on the "Montana or Bust" sign</I>. "I have
		got to talk to the police" I said. "WHAT... NOW. WHAT !!! NO WAY. I am
		going to set a record" he cried. "Then let me out", I replied. I knew
		I had to take care of this. I was already formulating plans in my
		head, what could I say or do that would work. Anything to get this
		asshole investigated. "Your kidding, I'm going right on through
		Billings non-stop"..."No I have no choice" I replied. The end of the
		on ramp was the start of the next off ramp. He veered off in a huff,
		up a long slow upgrade and pulled to a stop at the top to let me out.
		I started to look around as I got out. It was the middle of nowhere.
		Nothing around. Not a phone booth, store, gas station, traffic or
		witness. What if he was still coming for me? Fear still predominating.
		I tried to look back at the interchange where I had gotten out of the
		truck but it was too far to get a good take on it, there was too much
		going on. A long half mile away below me the highway gently curved to
		the right under the bridge, some kind of building or gas station on
		the right side of the bridge accross the road, cars coming down the
		ramp we had just used. Too damned risky. I settled down in the little
		sports car, ...no I'll keep going, "Then your in for the ride, we
		aren't stopping until Billings". A short time later we went through a
		toll booth and I thought about doing something then, but the terror
		was too fresh and I was feeling better with every mile. I'll file a
		report from Montana I told myself. I had his plate number, this guy
		was toast.
	</P>
	<P>His car was an MG or something like it. It roared as we speed
		across the plain. Pleasant company but not a lot of conversation, none
		of it very memorable. I watched the plain go past in a blur, we
		stopped for a quick dinner and on into the night. We crossed the
		Montana border at sunset the next day with a cry of jubilation from
		the driver and speed on. Just after sunset the wind suddenly began to
		howl and the car began to bounce up and down waking me up. The wind
		got more and more and more real quick. The car was starting to jump up
		and down as he pulled to a stop trying to regain control. I barely
		noticed as the sign tore off my pack in the back and whizzed by my ear
		on the way out. As the winds died quickly I realized what had happened
		and freaked. The plate number scratched on the sign was no more.</P>
	<P>We pulled into Billings late and slept the remainder of the
		night in his car on the Rim Rocks overlooking the city. He didn't want
		to disturb party he came to meet in the middle of the night. He
		dropped me by the highway in the morning and I continued on. In Big
		Timber I got stuck on the side of the Road for a while. It was there
		that I realized this was the last hitch of my life. Nope, never again.
		I must have had racked up 50K as a hitchhiking road warrior by that
		point in my life. That was my last road trip of any consequence. Gacy
		retired my thumb.</P>
	<P>It was so nice to be home. Mom, Dad, family, two cool nieces and
		peace. Security of sorts. Years in South East Asia, Cambodian refugee
		evacuations, Car caravans with crazy Iranians, three civil wars, then
		months of feeling like an alien at college. It was a few days before I
		picked up the phone for the first time to try to do something about my
		new problem.</P>
	<P>My first attempt was a series of frustrating calls each getting
		a "so what" reaction. I admit I didn't have a lot to go on. A Big guy
		driving a yellow pickup truck, owned a construction company, liked to
		dress up as a clown and entertain kids, was into politics. Can't you
		find him and arrest him :). I kept trying off and on for a few months
		getting nowhere. I gave up for a while. Then would try again. As long
		as a year and a half later I made repeat attempts, I didn't know that
		they had arrested him by then, but by then, I had put a name to the
		smell and I knew this was important.</P>
	<P>Later, working on a project to statistically analyze classified
		ads with friends in Bozeman, I got to telling them the story and
		started again. Four weeks of color coding classified ads with colored
		markers to track them leaves time for a lot of conversation. This time
		I went as far as to march into the little Bozeman Police station and
		filled out a written report with a female officer on the desk and
		requested that they forward it to the Chicago homicide police. She
		listened to my story and assured me she would forward the report to
		the right people. I had spent time on the Cambodian border. I knew a
		killer when I met one, I had met a lot of them. The lady at the
		station smiled, took it down. That was that. I made a few more calls
		after that then...Finally, I fully and completely gave up and put the
		incident behind me. That odd feeling of what if he comes after me that
		had lingered even during the years in Bozeman finally went away.</P>
	<P>I should be so lucky.</P>
	<P>
		I moved to Billings started the American Computer Network, got good at
		backgammon and started to spend my Corporate Presidents salary at the
		Rex bar in Billings. An entrepreneur in America. A PhD from MIT at 21
		named Mitchell Specter as an employee. The American dream. Peaceful
		serious work, good company, good times. Kicking the auto sales guy's
		ass in backgammon and trying to hustle the waitress with the double
		d's. After a game with Paul Fitzgerald (local politico organizer of
		some repute with a ten pound mustache and weird fish), I sat down to
		read the Billings Gazette. As I opened the pages a BIG photo on the
		right stared out at me. Independence Day music again. "Hey...I know
		that guy I exclaimed out loud". Then the headline. 33 dead under the
		house. "No I don't". Then the article. Construction Company, dresses
		as a clown, into politics. First the flush of excitement of being
		involved in something in the newspaper, then the realization of what
		had happened. The utter horror of their deaths, ...strangled while
		being homosexually raped. The worse thing was the pictures. They all
		seemed to look like me. Then the dates. Then the calculation. Oh my
		god. Eleven dead since my first call. In the six months after my
		encounter, until his arrest in December of that year, he had gone on a
		killing frenzy. Then the big one. What if I had made a 24th call.
		Those last eleven <B><U>really</U></B> did seem to look like me. I
		mean it was very very strange how much the last eleven looked like me.
		If you morphed them together... (I wonder). Similar ages, similar
		haircuts, similar similar similar...I lived with it for years.
		Survivors guilt, maybe... but maybe something more. After years of it
		you can imagine the intent with which, on August 1 1995, I embarked to
		stop a man who seemed bent on bringing down an airliner with hundreds
		of people...I was not being listened to again...but this time I vowed
		I would NEVER give up again.
	</P>
	<P>Dettling loved the tale when I briefly related it to him one day
		in his office. When they finally executed Gacy, I must admit to
		totally loosing it for several weeks both before and after. I sent him
		a FedEx at Joliet reminding him of our encounter, and of my sign, and
		telling him I was going to Piss on his grave. After the execution they
		announced an anonymous grave site. In those days before and after the
		execution, I was quite a spectacle. Hunter Thompson would have been
		proud. But if you don't go at least a little temporarily insane facing
		the thought of eleven gruesome murders you might have been able to
		stop, well then are you really worth anything at all ?</P>

	</H1>
	<br>
	<P align=center>
		These very disturbing series of coincidences are probably best read in
		light of the <a href="HabemusPapem.htm">Habemus Papam</a> story and
		after viewing my appearance in the international <a
			href=Video/Habemos.asf>News footage</a>, ...a Revelations event
		predicted in a thousand years of Catholic Dogma to accompany the
		election of this Pope. The Gacy coincidences are uniquely central to
		these events and span or include coincidences with almost every other
		event. I also find them quite disturbing, but having observed them
		feel they should be noted... so here goes. I Graduated from North
		Yarmouth Academy sometime late in June 1970, I am still trying to
		confirm a suspicion that as I delivered the Valedictorian address to
		my class, he was walking out of his prison cell for discharge on his
		first (non-lethal) sex charge stating "<a href="ElevenNever.htm">Never
			Again</a>" i.e. from now on no witnesses left alive (June 18, 1970, my address was mid late morning). I have a
		compression fracture of the Lumbar spine, Gacy had similar back
		injuries. I had a heart attack in 1996, Gacy claimed he was having <a
			href="ElevenHeart.htm">heart attacks</a> constantly. I unwittingly
		posed for a photo making a "Chi-Rho" with my hands with Dettling
		holding a Firestick, Gacy was membership chairman of the Catholic
		Chi-Rho club in springfield (See Firestick). I have been having an odd
		streetlight thing for some time (see Reading Kings- first but not only
		example)...Gacy was street light commissioner. <a href=ElevenBells.htm>Church
			Bells</a> tolled. (See The Two Noahs) Written text leads me to believe I
		escaped at Kennedy Expressway and Cumberland Ave. I grew up in <b>Cumberland</b>
		Maine and had interesting situations with both JFK Jr (See Welfare
		Motel Scandal) and his wife and her sister (See Treadmill Company-The
		Ear bar NYC). His handwriting has a more than subtle similarity to my
		<a href=http://www.handwriting.org/archives/98jan_01.html>handwriting.</a>
		(See Nathan R Note). His alcoholic and abusive father, considered one
		cause of his behavior, died on <a href="ElevenChristmas.htm">Christmas
			Day</a> (See JonBenet Ramsey). My encounter was in late May right about
		the 22nd, after which Gacy murdered until he got to the number of <b>thirty
			three</b>. Again, oddly, for an almost victim involved in the first
		biblical proof, <b>the age of Christ</b> !!! Gacy <a
			href="ElevenBible.htm"> read the Bible</a> aloud to his victims as he
		strangled them with a Garrote (JonBenet), and confessed using a <a
			href="ElevenRosary.htm">Rosary to demonstrate</a> how. I dug the hole
		that resulted in the first proof of a Biblical Passage, and appeared
		in the footage ahead of Pope Benedict at his election. The Day Care
		center he was hired to build... <b>"Angel House" for the Innocence
			project</b>, Karr had two children named "Angel and Innocence" (See
		JonBenet Ramsey). Gacy was ultimately caught over the disappearance of
		a Robert <b>Piest</b> (Close to Priest), a sophomore at <a
			href="ElevenMaine.htm">Maine West</a> high school (I went to <b>North</b>
		Yarmouth Academy, Yarmouth <b>Maine</b>) on (again) <b>December 11</b>
		(Same day as <b>God</b>zik 2 years earlier). "One short"... Gacy was
		justly and properly executed on May 10 1994, one day before my 42nd
		birthday.<br> (An eye for an eye).

		<b>Documentary Sources:</b> Sources for this story are first off, the
		unknown driver with his new fuzz-buster driving to visit someone in
		Billings,... my sister and nieces who heard the story at the time
		first hand, the Employees, all from Bozeman Mt who worked on the
		classified ad project (during which and in their presence I made my
		last 5 or 10 attempts) (Reann x, ) the Bozeman Montana female police
		officer (whom I asked to forward a formal report to Chicago Homicide),
		the patrons and staff of the Rex Bar (for days after I could talk of
		Nothing else) including John Karlsen, Paul Fitzgerald whom later
		became a political heavyweight in Billings and Montana politics, the
		Car sales guy who's lot was one block up from the Rex toward the Rim
		Rocks on the right side, the files of correspondence Gacy received at
		the time prior his execution, the fedex records from San Jose that
		transmitted the letter, John Greenleaf Saratoga Ca, and potentially any Chicago Homicide
		detectives who took my 20+ misplaced calls (Gacy lived in the
		suburbs), and lastly and perhaps most importantly, Gacy himself
		"speaking from the grave" through the testimony of the people guarding
		him. If he got my letter, my bet is he remembered the "Montana or Bust
		sign" and reacted. It does appear that he changed his funeral
		arrangements at the last minute. Research is underway for additional
		comparison photos. Years ago when I saw it it was stunning to me.
		(Survivors guilt or not will be for the reader to judge). The victim
		photos look different in different stories, the set I was looking at
		at the time was published in the San Jose Mercury News in Late April
		just before the execution. They were incredibly upsetting at the time.
		The dates are difficult to match, but Gacy was forced by neighbor complaints about the smells from his basement to move the bodys around and spread lime etc. That would match the overwhelming smell I got hit with.
