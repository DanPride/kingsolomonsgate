<P class=intro align=left>Dear Sir</p>

 <P class=intro align=left>My apologies for taking up so much of your time.</p>

 <P class=intro align=left>Attached please find a 32GB Flash drive containing original contiguous self shot video.
 All within the area under my rental agreement.I think this will really clarify the situation and make the case for charges quite strongly.
 Thank you, you were right, I should not have tried to edit reality to strengthen it.
 Completely unnecessary.</p>

 <P class=intro align=left>The level of terrorization exerted by this woman on everyone around her needs to be checked,
 or you will get serious, possibly deadly violence in the future I believe (but certainly not from me). According to her terrorized husband she is getting "exponentially worse lately". Despite her dilapidated condition. I think she is actually dangerous.
 It is clearly a case of accelerating Mental Illness as you will see.</p>

 <P class=intro align=left>I should note I have a strong motive for submitting this which deals with anticipation of future developments.
 And a desire to place certain things, which may be difficult to understand at first "on the record" as it were for future reference.</p>

<P class=intro align=left>To avoid wasting to much of your time I would point out several "points of interest" to draw your attention to.</p>

 <P class=intro align=left>
1:38.30   &nbsp;  &nbsp; A Personally embarrassing moment but one that clearly shows the extent to which I have become a prisoner in my room.</br>
1:56.21  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Exclamation and origination.</br>
1.56.45  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Naming Statement.</br>
1.57 48  &nbsp;  &nbsp; My Reaction to Terrys statement shouted up the stairs moments later that she was going to call the Police (enchance audible).</br>
2.03:18  &nbsp;  &nbsp; My Preparation to meet the Police (she never called them).</br>
2.26:00  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Forcible entrance and refusal to leave.</p>

<P class=intro align=left>Note: I am at this point wearing my heavy jacket whenever I leave my barricaded room as a precaution and protection against anything I don't see coming. Some peoples lives are just more interesting than others I guess :)</p>

<P class=intro align=left>The Mike on the computer is hyper sensitive. Normal breathing sounds like a strong wind. I would encourage you to use the
sound of the opening of a can of V8 at point 2:22.19 as a reference point to adjust the sound to its actual level.</p>
