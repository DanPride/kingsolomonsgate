		Man says he might have seen Karr in '96<br> By Todd Hartman,

	<P class=intro align=Center>Boulder District Attorney investigator
		Mark Spray has contacted a man who believes he could have encountered
		the JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect on a bus in the early morning hours
		of Dec. 26, 1996. Dan Pride, now of Portsmouth, N.H., said he was at
		the downtown bus station in Boulder sometime shortly after 12:30 a.m.
		when a man arrived, behaving strangely and bearing a resemblance to
		John Mark Karr, arrested last week in the case.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>He said the man didn't want to be
		noticed and pulled away when Pride asked if he had a light for a
		cigarette. The man boarded the same bus as Pride, and exchanged
		strange glances with him once aboard, Pride said.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Pride said the individual was wearing a
		Western fleece vest with a "shiny red spot" that Pride took to be a
		stain.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Asked how he could remember the event
		in such detail, Pride said it was because the man acted so strangely,
		and because he found out about JonBenet's death soon after. At some
		point after the murder, Pride said he called the tip into Boulder
		police.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Pride decided to again leave his tip
		with the DA's office Aug. 18. Spray contacted him five days later, and
		interviewed him over the phone, Pride said.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Pride provided an e-mail from Spray in
		which the investigator said he was interested in talking to him. Spray
		wanted to know what Pride was wearing on the same night, said Pride,
		who said he thought he could obtain the information from friends who
		had photos of a gathering that Pride attended on Christmas of 1996.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>It's impossible to know the
		significance of the interview. Those familiar with investigations said
		Spray could simply be following a lead that could put Karr in Boulder,
		or might have been trying to corroborate information that he'd already
		obtained elsewhere.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Pride said the stranger got off the bus
		on the highway outside of Boulder.</P>
	<P class=intro align=Center>Pride's story seems to have at least
		one hitch: The Ramsey house is some distance from the downtown Boulder
		bus station. Even if JonBenet's death occurred prior to midnight - the
		exact time is unknown - it's a significant walk from that property on
		15th Street to the bus depot.</P>
