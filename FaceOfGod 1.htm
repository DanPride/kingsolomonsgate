		Lutheran Hostel<BR> Old City, Jerusalem, Israel<BR> Aug 1
		2003 4:00 am<br>Thirty Two Years after King Solomon's Gate
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<P class=intro align=center>My only week in Jerusalem was at an end
		for this trip. I had spent most of it in the church of the Holy
		sepluchre reading the new testament for the first time. Reading it
		like I was cramming for an exam.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I kept looking to see if any of the
		Greek Priests were giving me funny looks and had felt reassured when
		they didn't. The old lady in Thessolonica musta just been having a bad
		day :)</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>At some point as I slept I began to
		dream, but this was somehow more than a dream. I felt as if I was in a
		huge space. A space filled with a thick smoky fog. Suddenly, a huge
		circular sun like face as big as a house came out of the fog with a
		rush more than filling my vision. I slowly scanned the surface of the
		face to the right and came upon an eye looking right at me. An eye
		very much like the eye of an elephant. The eye was intently watching
		me.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I sat bolt upgright, startled but not
		frightened, yet breathing heavily as if I had just run a mile. I shook
		my head, felt overwhelmed for a few minutes, then flopped back on the
		bed and back to sleep.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I began to dream again. A strange
		cartoon of a dream, silent, with the coloring of a Dick Tracy movie. I
		dreamed of a womans Labia open and aroused. A sudden burst of small
		white flowers burst forth like a chia pet ad. A Large finger
		penetrated and withdrew a white viscous substance revolting but
		without feature, smell or sound. I had no idea it was a prophetic
		dream, but it had an odd quality that made it hard to forget and easy
		to think about.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I woke up and dashed for Lod Airport
		just making my flight, having stopped too long at Gezer on the way. It
		had been a difficult trip, robbed of my wallet in the Paris subway and
		stunned at the worthlessness of my dollars, funds had run low after
		only a few months and it was time to cut the trip short and go back to
		work. I expected no problems, having my pick of several positions that
		were open upon my return.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>All I had to do was get there.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I arrived in London on August 1st
		(again) and headed for the ticket counter to rebook my flight for the
		states. Greeted by a line of hundreds perhaps a thousand cranky
		passengers, I learned of the British Airways strike. All flights were
		full and the quckest flight I could get, without buying a new ticket,
		was my existing ticket more than thirty days out. I was stuck. Stuck
		in the most expensive city in the world with funds dissappearing and
		everything but my passport and a few travelers checks made off with.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I found the cheapest hostel I could
		take in Earls Court and sat back to consider my options.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>During breakfast the next day two
		czecks were discussin their summer jobs they were about to start in
		some place called Wisbeck north of Cambridge, picking flowers
		piecework with housing. Flowers? hmmmm. How bad could it be for a
		month? ...and I got to spend more time in England, a big plus in my
		eyes. I decided to go for it, they were nice guys and it sounded like
		an Peace Corps class adventure.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>It was</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>So began life as a British farm hand.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>It required a few adjustments, mostly
		living with 8 Polish students, me and the two czecks in a two bedroom
		bungalo, but after adjusting to the arrangements, it was, mostly,
		fun.... All except the daily toil.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>You would think that there could be no
		more pleasurable labor type work than picking flowers. But the first
		look at all the beauty soon gave way to the awareness of the
		pesticides that drenched the fields.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I began to reflect on the symbolisim of
		the dream. Mother earth producing an abnormal host of flowers, pushed
		to the limits of efficiency, beauty becoming a monster, production
		pushed to the limits and enforced by poison. A poison I could feel in
		my own body daily.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I told my coworkers of the dream, and
		its odd coincidence with labor, and I began to wonder if the second
		part would somehow manifest itself and if it did what would it be?</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I always enjoy doing offbeat things
		that give me a new take and another slice of life and people. I was a
		minor celebrity in this environment. I was the only American farm
		laborer that they had ever seen working the fields. I also wasn't very
		good at it, but I also didn't really care, I was just killing time as
		a tourist of a different color.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>I continued on my first read of the
		biblical text and wondered about the second part of the dream. Would
		it also come to something? Being an American with a US Passport, I
		became aware of being an object of interest to a number of the female
		workers who obviously saw in me a quick and legal way to their land of
		dreams... America of course. I rejected an offer of 3000 pounds to
		marry and continued to wait out the few weeks to my flight.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>The answer came with a knock at the
		door from the tuft running the crew. He had a proposition for me. A
		steady hourly wage working in a factory if I would only drive his
		brother in law down the street to and from the factory each day. I
		readily accepted... quite sick of being daily poisoned by pesitides.</p>
	<P class=intro align=center>As I waited out the last two weeks til
		my flight I had a lot of time to think about the second part of the
		dream. Time spent thinking of the limits and of the abuse the
		agriculture industry was inflicting on the bounty of Mother earth.
		Time spend looking at an endless number of horrible white blobs. Time
		spend marveling at the prophetic qualities of the wierd and powerful
		dream.... Time spent picking rotten onions, ugly, white, revolting and
		viscous, off a conveyer belt as thousands of onions extracted from
		mother earth sped by.</p>
