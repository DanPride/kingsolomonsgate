<H1 align=center>The Rose</H1>
<P class=intro align=center>Boston Logan Airport<BR>
Boston Mass<BR>
Feb 1985?</p>
<P class=intro align=center>I wondered what would happen as I stood there in 
the airport waiting for her to get off the plane. I felt a little foolish and 
confused standing there holding a single long stem rose in a box. I had not 
seen her in ten years.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>My thoughts scanned over our shared history. The 
breakfast lunches and dinners we shared as part
of the same group freshman year. The romantic evenings in Brooks Hall sleeping 
in embrace. Long nights of pillowtalk to the sounds of Graham Nash records played and
replayed. The parting for her Junior year abroad and my request that she stay, 
my joking but half serious proposal as a reason not to go. </p>
<P class=intro align=center>She was now someone elses wife I reminded myself, 
but it had always seemed that circumstance and fate had stolen her from me. 
Was she unhappy now,... was that why she was flying to see me. Was there a chance 
now?</p>
<P class=intro align=center>I reflected on that day when Bruce Gavett hurredly 
entered the ASG office proclaiming "Hey L's going to Marry Dave (withheld)" 
as he sat down at his desk. I looked up with a shock and blurted out "Oh Shit". 
It took a few seconds for it to sink in. Gavett had already started pouring over 
his ledgers as I reacted. Then he looked up with a surprise and an "Oh... 
<i>Oh R.E.A.L.L.Y....</i>." as he twirled his mustache mischevously peering at my shocked 
expression.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>In the year since she had gone abroad things had 
taken unexpected twists and turns. At that age a year was a lifetime of experiences.
 Somehow I had missed her return from Junior Year abroad. Political turmoil and 
personal political attacks on me had consumed me and my thinking. I had not seen 
her since her return. Gavett's announcement stopped me in my tracks. With so much to 
deal with at the time it seemed like just one more thing that had gone wrong. 
I made it through the second term of my student office, then joined the Peace 
Corps and left Allegheny behind. In Thailand I took to the Joke that the Peace Corps
was America's version of the French Foreign Legion.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>I had thought of her frequently over the years 
along with others who had been my lovers which she had not yet become. 
Mostly it was fond thoughts of a friend I had always loved. After being 
run over by a tow truck she had seen my
note in the Alumni Bulletin and been the one to call, then after several 
letters she had said she wanted to come visit to my pleasent surprise.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>I worried about her reaction to my now broken 
face. Having been made suddenly ugly and deformed by the fractured jaw 
was something I was still trying to deal with. I wondered what her reaction 
would be.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>As she walked toward me there was that shy cute 
grin that she always greeted me with just the same as it has always been. 
Her demur acceptance of the token of my affection immediately told me she 
was being moved by feelings as strong and romantic as my own. We were at 
my shared apartment in minutes and in bed  moments later making passionate 
love.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>The wounds I had suffered disappeared from my 
mind and I invested my soul in her with no thought to her marriage. We had 
not even mentioned it in the minutes following our reunitment, nor in our letters. It was the
only of the "Big Ten" I feel I ever broke. </p>
<P class=intro align=center>As we traded 
affection and conversation we heard the sound of the cat  
rummaging in the Living room area of the small shared unit. 
Right as were were consumating 
our new relationship there had been a crash in the room. The continued 
sounds of the cat rummaging and fussing had made us both look at each other in 
puzzled laughter during a momentary pause. We wondered what he could possibly be doing to create such a racket.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>Later, we emerged to discover the rose now broken and 
lying on the floor by itself. The plastic box holding the single long stem Rose had been bitten, clawed and torn open and the stem of the rose chewed in half by the black cat.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>I gave her the half with the rose and took the 
stem with its thorns for myself. Prophetically saying "thats probably all 
I am going to get out of this". After several more 
visits, an August 3rd Graham Nash concert on Boston Common, and after meeting and stuggling to accept her son as my own she returned 
to her husband and left me alone with my wounds. It seemed like a sign, a feeling I would get over and over again. This time a sign 
for what the only adultery of my life would yield me. 
Nothing but the thorns.</p><br><br>
<P class=intro align=left><small>Footnote:Tragically, L's son Graham died in a car crash two 
days after her divorce utlimately became final some years later. The unfairness
of life sometimes seems to have no bounds.</small>
