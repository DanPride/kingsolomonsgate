<P class=body align=left><STRONG>BODY:</STRONG> </P>
<P class=body align=left>The FBI has given copies of a 35,000-word manifesto 
written by the terrorist known as the <STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> to dozens of 
university professors in the hope they can <STRONG>identify</STRONG> the writing 
as the product of a former student or colleague. </P>
<P class=body align=left>The bomber, believed by authorities to be responsible 
for killing three people and injuring 23 since 1978, sent the manuscript in June 
to the New York Times and The Washington Post, saying he would refrain from 
killing anyone else if either paper published it in its entirety within three 
months. Neither paper has made a decision yet. </P>
<P class=body align=left>Many of the professors shown the manuscript, a learned 
screed against technology, are experts in the history of science. </P>
<P class=body align=left>"What we're trying to stress is this whole idea of the 
history of science, and people who might have been in the right places at the 
right time, who have maybe seen or heard comments from someone whose words and 
writings are very similar to this," Terry Turchie, assistant special agent in 
charge of the San Francisco-based UNABOM Task Force, said yesterday. </P>
<P class=body align=left>Members of the task force believe the bomber was 
exposed to the history of science or some related discipline in the late 1970s 
in the Chicago area, possibly at the University of Illinois at Chicago or at 
Northwestern University, where the first two bombs were found. </P>
<P class=body align=left>The FBI believes he then moved to the Salt Lake City 
area in 1980 and 1981, then finally to Northern California, where he may have 
had "some sort of contact" with the University of California at Berkeley, in the 
words of an FBI statement to be made public today. Two bombs were placed in a 
computer sciences building at Berkeley in 1982 and 1985. </P>
<P class=body align=left>"Obviously the <STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> knows his way 
in and around a college campus. Whether or not he's been successful in achieving 
advanced degrees is subject to speculation," said Jim R. Freeman, special agent 
in charge of the San Francisco office. </P>
<P class=body align=left>For much of his criminal career the 
<STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> chose to remain unnervingly silent about what seemed 
to be a random campaign against unrelated industries and academic fields. The 
FBI called him UNABOM because his early targets worked in universities or for 
airlines. The bomber called himself "FC," for Freedom Club, though the FBI 
thinks the membership in the group is limited to the bomber himself. The only 
credible sighting of the bomber was in 1987, outside a Salt Lake City computer 
store just before an explosion. He was decribed by a <STRONG>witness</STRONG> as 
a man with curly reddish-blond hair and a light mustache. </P>
<P class=body align=left>He resurfaced six years later, in June 1993 when, two 
days apart, university professors were seriously injured with mail bombs. While 
only one person was killed in the first 14 incidents, his two most recent bombs 
proved lethal, last December when a New Jersey advertising executive opened a 
bomb in his house, and then in April when the president of the California 
Forestry Association was killed in his office by a mail bomb addressed to 
someone else. </P>
<P class=body align=left>With that incident the <STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> 
suddenly became discursive, sending letters to newspapers, a former victim, a 
college professor and, most dramatically, unveiling his manifesto, entitled, 
"Industrial Society and Its Future." </P>
<P class=body align=left>The FBI has placed no restrictions on the professors 
who have been given copies of the manuscript. They can copy it and share it with 
whomever they want, or conceivably even make the text available on the Internet. 
Of this last possibility, Turchie said, "We haven't encouraged that." Asked if 
the FBI had thought of posting it on the Net, Turchie said, "It wasn't sent to 
us. It's not really ours to publish or make public." </P>
<P class=body align=left>When he sent the manuscript to The Post and the Times, 
the <STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> enclosed a letter saying the Times has first 
claim to publish the manuscript and that "the same bargain" is offered to The 
Post if the Times does not print it or have it published "reasonably soon." 
Penthouse magazine has offered to publish the manuscript, but the bomber said 
that if it is the only publication that publishes it, he will plant another bomb 
with the intention to kill. </P>
<P class=body align=left>"We are continuing to talk it over with people at the 
New York Times and are consulting with responsible public officials," Donald E. 
Graham, publisher of The Post, said yesterday. "The document we received was 
postmarked June 24, and said that first the Times and then The Post would have 
three months to think it over. And quite obviously it takes some thinking about. 
It is not an easy decision." <A name=Excerpts></A></P>
<P class=body align=left><b><a href="../AbelHarris.htm">Excerpts of the manifesto, about 3,000 words, are being 
published in today's Post.</a></b> Leonard Downie Jr., The Post's executive editor, said 
the excerpts would permit readers to see some of the material the FBI is making 
available to the academic community. "While the excerpts are a small fraction of 
the whole document, they are representative of the thoughts in it," Downie said. 
</P>
<P class=body align=left>The document draws on a mix of academic disciplines, 
notably psychology and sociology, to argue that individuals in modern society 
are too easily able to meet their basic needs for survival, and suffer from a 
"disruption" of the "power process," which leads to depression, low self-esteem, 
guilt, anxiety, sexual perversion, etc. </P>
<P class=body align=left>One retired professor of government who has written 
about technology and received the manifesto from the FBI on Monday said he was 
impressed by the bomber's intelligence. </P>
<P class=body align=left>"I was surprised how bright this guy seems. It could 
have stood a lot of editing, obviously. It was remarkably coherent and precise. 
His prescription is absurd, but I liked a good deal of his diagnosis," the 
professor said. </P>
<P class=body align=left>Keith Benson, executive secretary of the History of 
Science Society in Seattle, said yesterday he was shown letters last October 
written by the <STRONG>Unabomber,</STRONG> including one in which he said he had 
been a doctoral degree candidate in history at the University of Utah, working 
on a dissertation about the history of the behavioral sciences. </P>
<P class=body align=left>Based on what he read, Benson said of the anarchist, 
"He's smart enough to talk fairly knowledgeably about the history of science." 
</P>
<P class=body align=left>One historian whose work is cited in the UNABOM 
manuscript, Roger Lane of Haverford College, said that based on a description of 
the citation, the <STRONG>Unabomber</STRONG> basically understood his thesis, 
that the industrial revolution brought a degree of conformity to Americans that 
had not been necessary to citizens in more solitary pursuits such as farming. 
</P>
<P class=body align=left>"This is not a volume that was ever a major 
best-seller, and that he should have gone through it carefully is very 
interesting," Lane said. </P>
<P class=body align=left>The FBI has at least 150 people working on the case. 
Freeman and Turchie said yesterday they are optimistic they can catch the 
<STRONG>Unabomber.</STRONG> </P>
<P class=body align=left>"We're not frustrated. We're very motivated," Freeman 
said. "We're very confident we're going to solve the case." &nbsp;</FONT></FORM>
