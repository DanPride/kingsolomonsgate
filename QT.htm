<P class=intro align=left>"All right, All right, Jeezz your a pain in the ass 
sometimes. There's all kind of women here, why do you want to go all the way 
across town at 2:00... the bar is going to be closed by the time we get there 
anyway". He was insistent and I was starting to suddenly feel pretty down and 
drunk. Things hadn't been going very well. This was starting to look like a four 
year run into nowhere. Venture capitol star of the Montana oil patch to dead end 
in a Moving Van. I kinda snickered at myself. Jeezz, I had even debased myself in 
front of a former enemy, unbelievable. I had actually forgotten how bovine it 
was to watch <B>Q. Todd Dickinson</B> (as in son of the Devil) gloat. In all the 
years of our <A href="AlleghenyDickinson.htm">political and 
social competition</A> at college, it had been a fortuitously rare sight. 
<A 
href="ASG73.htm"><IMG  hspace=10

border=1></A>
Now he 
was on his way up... Up all the way to the edges of <i>"Accident Bill" </i>Clinton's cabinet as things turned out.
 Somehow my grand proposal to build an e-bay in every 7-11 
must have found its way to his desk. An obviously gay 
Lawrence Expressway Venture Cap just south of Palo Alto had surprised me out of the blue by saying he was 
interested in meeting about the proposal. He was now a venture capitol lawyer <U>apparently</U> 
<i>(NOT - Chevron Oil)</i>.</p>
<P class=intro align=left> The meeting had consisted of Todd icily staring at me as he
 drummed his fingers on the Desk. Nearly the only words he spoke in those minutes were that he "had no interest whatsoever".
It left me puzzled as to the purpose of the meeting. It 
certainly didn't feel like he missed me and desired my charming company. The 
meeting had been rather cold and odd to say the least. <I>Why had he bothered</I> if he had no interest? 
<P class=intro align=left>Fagan nudged my arm again, I spun around at him and blurted out, "Yea and I was 
just talking to two gorgeous chicks before you blew it". He had rudely and 
very purposely blown off two very interesting women I was talking with. "They 
were law students for crying out loud", I said. "Sit down its too damned late, 
it will be closed by the time we get there". "What's this anyway, our third time 
back here"?</p>
<P class=intro align=left>
 I was a little peeved. Besides I was starting to feel staggering. I 
was probably going to sit on a sidewalk or walk down by the boats long before I 
went anywhere. Still, I didn't want to be too hard on him. He was the only 
friend I had in San Francisco. ...and the sob had just blown my shot at a 
second. I was dismal. I wanted to be back in the cabin in the Redwoods at the 
hostel in Saratoga brushing luxurious golden hair with a gentle rain on the roof 
and the sweet smell of wet Redwoods filling my nostrils. "God I am stupid 
sometimes when you offer me gifts the likes of her company" ...I silently 
thought to myself as I did my best imitation of a Jewish gesture with my right 
hand. I deserved to be stuck with this ugly Rhode Island heavy metal, needle 
starter level, dressed down <u>rodeo clown</u> with the speech impediment. The guy made 
me laugh, especially his outlandish driving. He kept claiming he'd 
ridden the bike all the way from Rhode Island, and every time he said it, I 
looked at him and just sort of smiled and thought to myself   "How the hell 
did he make it". </P><BR>
<P class=intro align=left>Somehow Fagan got me on to the sidewalk, its all in a big 
hurry and a blur. His voice keeps insisting "the other bars going to close", "the other bars going to 
close", "Hurry", "Hurry", "Come on... we can make it". He escorts me by the elbow toward the bike parked on the sidewalk.  
Fagan inexplicably waves at a cab driving by (very slowly) in the street to move on. 
The cab drives,... on as instructed,...  and pulls over to the right about a hundred feet 
up the road. "<U><B><I>Man that guy is everywhere"</I></B></U>, I said out 
loud.... I had seen the same cab driver several times that night around 
the city, later I would realize near each of the close calls of the evening.
 (Robert Milne, VP of Yellow Cab - a firm with strong long term interests in Parking Commission issues).</p>
<P class=intro align=left> Fagan hops on the bike first. "Now wait a minute... we 
had agreed when we left the hotel that I would drive". The argument ensues. 
"Besides, the drivers out here are crazy. They're unbelievable, They are 
just plain bad. Dangerous. Not only that but You can't drive for shit". I had 
saved his butt ...not once ...but <B>twice</B> tonight, and on that last one the 
incredible stupid SOB had <I><B><U>thrown his weight the wrong way</U></B></I> 
and very nearly clocked us both. </p>
<P class=intro align=left>
I tried to point all this out during the short 
argument, but, finally, I wind up on the back because I was suddenly too 
drunk,  <b>but</b> I had been driving the rest of the night with no problem at all. </p>
<P class=intro align=left>
 And its a blur of motion,... a racing start too fast and the <B>cab pulls out as we leave</B>. 
Fagan swerves around it. One close call already. By mid block I say screw it 
and wrap my arms around his waste. He goes freaky on me grabbing at my hand, 
then <B>bending my forefinger back</B> forcing me to let go and grab the strap 
at the bottom of the seat between my legs. I was shocked at the 
rudeness of it. The bike slows to 10 as he gets my arms off his waist, (Examine Accident Dynamics) the bike 
staggers, then he's off like a rocket again. I start screaming at him to slow 
down. I start to throw my weight back and forth to wag the motorcycle. 
"There's a car back on the right I hope this idiot sees it",...I thought as I apply more pressure. 
"Slow down" I scream again. It'll be a reasonable ride... or I'll just as soon 
meet the pavement right now. The <B>Cab overtakes us</B> over my right shoulder 
as Fagan drops the speed of the bike to avoid me flipping us, <B>the cab drops 
far back.</B> Fagan relented a little more, down to about thirty from 
fifty for the last half block, delaying our arrival at the appointed spot by 
several seconds, then with a roar, he <B>speeds up again with a burst</B> 
...as we sail over the hump, and I am hurled into the path of the waiting tow 
truck (breaking my back and Jaw in 4 places)...I feel my body start to rise and 
the bike forcibly shift to the right underneath me propelled by Fagan's Leap off the bike and his 
barrel role toward the Manhole cover (<a href="QT/0037.htm">
Police Report</a>). It is falling away from me, 
between my legs as my body rises. I feel the edge of the Bikes seat hitting hard 
against the inside of my right leg [leaving a nasty bruise], the seats square 
edge impacting above the knee and down across the inside of the kneecap and then 
the film stops. Blank. Darkness. Then a voice floats in "You've been in an 
accident", "Do you understand", "You've been in an accident", "Do you 
understand". Vague memories float back over the years of two people standing 
over me watching me writhe and spit blood.</P>
<hr >
<P class=intro align=left>To fully understand these events you need to 
carefully examine the dynamics of the accident and the police reports and 
transcripts (below). The single most important fact of the accident itself is 
that the driver (Fagan) leapt from the motorcycle <B><U>BEFORE</U></B> the 
impact <A href="QT/0037.htm">landing near the 
manhole cover</A>, and the passenger (me) and the bike were propelled into the 
tow trucks path. The Bike is damaged <B>!!!!!!<A 
href="QT/0024.htm">ON THE RIGHT SIDE <I>NOT ON THE LEFT SIDE</I></A> !!!!!!</B>. The tow truck driver (Klimper) <A 
href="QT/0010.htm">quits his job</A> immediately 
after the accident and moves from his slum SRO shared motel room into a "<A 
href="QT/0013.htm">Large well maintained 
estate</A>". From Hotbunking in an SRO to this (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=70+marcela+street,+san+francisco+california&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us&ei=aZcCSv3UGZCMtgeQyp2BBw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1">Click Here and do Street View</a>) Two independent key witnesses who were perfectly  positioned 
to see everything, are rudely excluded from telling what they saw and never 
identified. They depart proclaiming to any who will listen "Yea we know what 
time it is". A key witness, Robert Milne, a Vice President of a Taxi company 
dealing extensively with <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/speeches/qtd.htm">
Dickinson's parking commission</a>, lies about key facts of 
the accident and is seen during the preceding two other near accidents that very night. Milne 
exhibits a strong <A href="QT/0034.htm">active 
interest</A> in the trial following the accident for an uninvolved party 
arriving at a random accident. He actively tries to <A 
href="QT/0025.htm">discredit all other 
witnesses</A>. Police bias raises 
<A href="QT/0071.htm">
suspicions</a> in the defense of a Police/ABC Towing
connection. Insurance company <b>pre existing</b> investigations into Milne are known
 to exist but details are unavailable. Milne's secret passenger is sent from the scene and never identified.
Two police officers appear immediately on the scene but 
are unlisted in the records. A radiator hose blows on the unknown squad car at a 
unusual time (after its stopped for several minutes) creating confusion while 
the victim (me) is "tended to". Activities are then further interrupted, 
perhaps fortuitously, by the arrival of a city bus.  The tow truck is 
described as driving unusually leading up the the accident as if timing itself 
to the lights, and exhibits anticipatory behavior at 
the accidents intersection. Milne's cab drives in synch with the bike in the 
blocks preceding the accident. (Communications?). <A

<P class=intro align=left>Fagan correctly testified we had four beers each over 
the several hours we were bombing back and forth in search of destiny between a 
half dozen different bars. However, he lied when he said I had been drinking 
before that. He called then picked me up at the Lafayette that night about 11, 
saying it would cheer me up and get me out of the room and he'd buy the beers. 
He did, and as a consequence controlled the schedule of the evening as well. The 
evening was a series of one quickly gulped beer then a drive across town to 
another bar always <A href="QT/0018a.htm">at 
Fagan's insistence</A>. The trips were one close call after 
another.  I remember stumbling as I approached the Bike to argue with 
Fagan, but given the consumption that night should not have been drunk. We 
argued about who would drive when he picked me up, and I told him forget it, I 
was going up to bed rather than ride with him, that settled it, with me driving 
for the first few passes back and forth between the bars.  One one 
occasion, the day before I sold my bike,  I pulled out of an alley and 
gunned it down the street near the Lafayette. As I to got up to about 45, this 
car pulled a fast Uie out of a parking space right into my path, forcing me to 
lay the bike down and ride it (sitting/laying on top, burning my thigh on the 
engine) to avoid an impact, and succeeded in lessening it. I met, but do 
not yet clearly recall the portly individual. The damage on the side of the bike 
forced me to take less than the price I had already set with the musician in San 
Jose who bought it the next day. Those first driving experiences my first time 
in "Frisco", started my long, intense dislike of the city. Randomly (?) meeting 
a 20ish guy with Spiderman tattoos, and getting severely poisoned a few weeks 
before, didn't improve my impressions. The first real incident the night of the 
accident, the second time we left the bar, was at the EXACT same 
intersection. <U>Fagan leaned right</U> into the oncoming truck and I stood on 
my left leg on the peg, leaned a full two feet out to the left, pulling on the 
handle bars, and gunned it barely missing getting clipped by a truck, (don't 
know if it was the same one). At the time I yelled at him, I couldn't believe 
the stupidity, but wrote if off, concluding, he was a bozo rider as well as 
driver apparently. If I had not slowed him down by wagging the bike in the 
blocks preceding the accident, the circumstance of the accident would have 
delivered me like a sack of grain right UNDERNEATH an oncoming tow 
truck.<BR></P>

<P class=intro align=left>*To Dance: between speeds of 30 and 60 you turn the 
extended front wheel back and forth almost on a second count ("one second womp 
two second womp") catching the edge of the front tire so it makes a slight whomp 
or catch sound at the verge of a topple....swaggering the bike and body in an S 
motion appropriately. A continuous refinement of the edge. </P><BR>
