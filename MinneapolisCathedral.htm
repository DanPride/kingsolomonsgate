Writer<BR class=br><BR class=br><B>BODY:</B><BR class=br>The "voices of St. 
Paul" are silent, and they may not speak again for months.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I share the unhappy news that the 
bells of the <B>Cathedral</B> of St. Paul - bells that have become familiar and 
beloved since they were installed 18 years ago - have fallen silent, and that no 
one knows how long it will be before they ring again.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you how much I love the 
<B>cathedral</B> bells after a thunderstorm struck St. Paul on July 11 and 
<B>lightning</B> fried a computer component that regulates the five bronze 
bells. They were knocked out of commission for 10 days, silencing the tolling of 
the hours and the ringing of the Angelus at noon and 6 p.m. The ancient ritual 
calls the faithful to prayer with a stirring pealing of the bells that exceeds 
100 chimes, and it used to drive Protestants to conversion or out of the 
neighborhood. Last time I numbered the chimes, during a noon Angelus in June, I 
counted 148 separate bongs, and life was good. <BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, in the middle of a political 
season that makes me alert to any sign or sound of heaven, God is throwing us 
hurricanes, and the bells of St. Paul have been hushed.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they can't be fixed by 
replacing a $49 computer part. The job will be a lot bigger and a lot more 
expensive: Cracks have been discovered in the steel yokes from which the bells 
hang in the southeast tower of the cathedral.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lightning stopped them, the 
bells were back in operation by July 21. But just eight days later, cracks were 
discovered during a routine inspection. Unfortunately, there will be nothing 
routine about fixing them.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight and a half tons of bells were 
cast by a French firm and installed by two American companies, and if you think 
that lawyers may have to help sort out the liabilities before any workers get 
their hands on repairing the actual problem, then you're familiar with the ways 
of the world.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
cathedral has contacted the French manufacturer and its American partners, 
asking whether the yokes shouldn't have lasted longer and whether they might 
have been designed without enough respect for the extremes of Minnesota 
weather.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no 
immediate threats of lawsuits, and the initial communications between the 
cathedral and the companies that installed the bells have been civil. But the 
earliest that they will be heard again is during the Christmas season. And there 
is no guarantee that they will ring then.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It could be next spring," says Alan 
Spillers, the cathedral's communications director, who delivered the grim news 
to me Thursday. "And that's if we started today, and the weather was fine, and 
we were able to work out all the responsibilities."<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you'd like to hear the bells again 
soon, prayer may be the best hope.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cost $280,000 when they were 
installed in time for Christmas in 1986. In today's money, that's about 
$460,000. Spillers estimates the cost of getting them down from the bell tower, 
storing them and replacing the five yokes - all of which must be custom made - 
at between $50,000 and $80,000. That's an early estimate, and it's not clear 
which companies are responsible for making which repairs and which costs may 
have to be picked up by the cathedral, a self-supporting parish of about 3,000 
members.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's terrible," 
says Spillers. "No one's laughing about it here. The first thing we have to do 
is discuss the responsibilities and whether it was faulty design or what. That 
means lawyers are involved, and you might say the letters are in the mail. But 
we are committed to doing this [repairing the bells], by hook or by crook."<BR 
class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells range in size from 
three-quarters of a ton all the way up to almost three and a half tons, with the 
largest and loudest one dedicated to the apostle whose name was bestowed on the 
capital city.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 
yokes holding the two largest bells were found to be cracked, cathedral 
officials turned off the mechanical system that swings the bells from side to 
side and switched to an electrical system that rings them by activating 
clappers. If you went past the cathedral in late July or early August, and the 
bells sounded strangely hollow, it was because they were motionless, being 
struck by the clappers.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further inspections revealed cracks in 
the smaller yokes as well, and consultants warned that even the electronic 
clappers might be putting too much stress on the faulty yokes.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late August the bells went silent for 
the duration.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took 71 
years from the opening of the cathedral in 1915 until the bells went up. With 
any luck, it won't take that long to get them ringing again.<BR class=br><BR 
class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Paul is not the same without them. 
Unfortunately, there is no choice but to keep the bells muffled until their 
yokes can be replaced. Hanging 100 feet above the street, eight and a half tons 
of bronze bells would make a big dent, not to mention a big noise, if they 
should fall.<BR class=br><BR class=br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would 
be a bell ringing that the people of St. Paul never want to hear.<BR
