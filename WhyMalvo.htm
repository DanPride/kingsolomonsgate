<p class=bible align=Center><b>Opinion</b></p>
<p class=bible align=Center><b>The timing</b> of the Malvo shootings is the single most critical feature to understand in the debate about September 11th and the Iraq War. It is the perfect perfecta night for the track managers wife, ...all composed of long shots, ...one in every race. The Malvo shootings blew the Iraq war debate right off the front page. They started blowing peoples heads off in the press the day the Iraq war debate started, they continued blowing peoples heads off in the press with a frenzy and a total media madness so intense that it the blocked out the rays of the sun itself,... until shortly <b>after</b> the Declaration of War.
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
No One heard the Iraq war debate. No one remembers the position of thier Senator? or A change in the horse race count? A dramatic speech by a stunning statesman that will be remembered for all time? a "4 score..." barnburner of a speach? No, None of that,... just blank. All our memories are blank or pale gray at best.
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
But... why is this important? Unfortunate timing? Then...one long shot just won a race. But the Daily Double that night was the hijackers training at the CIA flight school (Humbolt Aviation) in Florida. The third race was yet another stunner with 400 million in short selling on American Airlines on Sept 10 2001. It beat silly the normal 25K daily volume on just the Chicago Exchange, to say nothing of the volumes in Paris and Bonn. The race crowd buzzed at the bangup start to the night. It was almost as good as the 87 Pennant homer by Mitchell Page. The Kids all wanted to buy a $2 ticket on the Longshot for the fourth race but the Adults knew sagely that life ain't all long shots and big payoffs. <br>
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
<b>But</b> at the head of the stretch in the fourth race the Anthrax Date slammed through the Post Office, written with an American Format. Lame and still limping and coming-up-wide to the Finish line... 13 Anthrax Genome specialists commit suicide or die in the following six months until "they" admit it can <b>now</b> be genetically tracked to the batch and not just to the strain, <b>...made at Fort Dietrick Maryland</b>. It was a photo finish with a result as amazing the Daily Double, even beating the third race action.
</p><p class=bible align=center>
The crowd was beginning to doubt their sanity that this could all happen in one night when the fifth race crescendo's toward the largest perfecta payout in history for the Managers wife. The only terrorist search warrant turned down in 2001 out of hundreds is Masaoui's computer search request.  399 approvals and wouldn't you know it but "the" single search request denial pops up in the fifth on this amazing night. A one in four hundred long long shot. Desk Jockey Colleen Rowley filed a protest at the result saying her wording had been changed without her permission, and it was illegal to do so, but the judge disallowed ...and the Perfecta Mountain of Cash swelled incredibly.
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
Before the crowd could even catch their breath, the sixth was just incredible incredible accidental timing. The track was wet and all six horses went down at once letting  Rumsfeld's horse of the apocalypse come from way behind to give a july surprise. The shoot down procedures are changed so only he can approve it, and Mr Rumsfeld is conveniently unavailable at "the moment" on Sept 11. 
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
A fat lady in the stands collapsed after the seventh, in disbelief,  when the WTC tower seven holding the CIA records gave a precision collapse of absolute perfection and it wasn't even hit by a plane in the race... it went straight down in perfect lines that would have had demo experts clapping backs and all by happenstance. 
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
The Perfecta Mountain got challenged for the second time of the night in the eighth, when the programers in switzerland filed a protest that they actually did recover the stock market hard drives like the insurance company wanted and discovered hundreds of millions of questionable  transactions in that hour before the planes, most  of them linked to the CIA. But again in a streak of long shots, the Judge Disallowed again. 
</p><p class=bible align=Center>Long odds indeed. One longer when you include John Muhammad's "Special Ops" military training and Malvo's claims the elder Military Muhammed had Brainwashed him, "Look what a Monster you Made me". And on top of the pile we are supposed to believe the Malvo shootings were just a coincidence. We are expected to believe it automatically, as automatic as a reflex in a physical exam. We <b>Know</b> our Government could not be so evil... Even if the sniper attacks did completely obscure the Iraq War Debate and make it a painless vote for the Senators... perfectly coincidental. Painful for the motorist with an empty tank, but painless for the Senators we all admire.</p><p class=bible align=Center>So we gather around the Track Managers wife with sheepish smiles and feel blessed to be part of the scene. "Congradulations your REALLY a winner tonight" "The best night yet for you" "Boy if I could ever have a night like the Track Managers wife" we say to each other... we concentrate on our envy at her piles of loot, and avoid each others eyes least they see our intellectual cowardice.
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
But now its time for the Ninth. We still have the ninth race to run. 
</p><p class=bible align=Center>
Its the last Race of the Night. A time of heros and villains and each must decide their fate, pick their side. "With us or against us" is for each of us to choose. Evil is in our midst and we had better beware.
