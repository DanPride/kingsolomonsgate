<H1 align=center>Abel's Last Card Game</H1>
<P align=center>Abel Harris "I am My Brothers Keeper."
<br>Bunratty's Bar, Boston Mass<BR><small>(Now the Wonder Bar)</small></P>
<P align=center><B>August 1</B>, 1987 </P>
<P class=story align=left><I>Around Dawn the Day of the Murder</I></P>
<P class=story align=left><b>"Hey, I am Abel, you know like in the Bible, I am my 
Brothers Keeper" Abel said.</b> The game of hearts included Gypsy Blanchette, Abel, 
A J Wachtel?, and several other Boston Heavy Metal fans. We all sat in a circle 
in the living room of my apartment at 1353 Beacon Street #2 in Brookline. My 
Nine room rent control had become the after-hours hot spot of Bunratty's bar to 
Peter Thompson's displeasure. It was a slow evening, things had actually calmed 
down enough towards dawn that Abel pulled out a deck of cards and started a 
game. Now wait a minute I replied " Are you crazy? They don't pay you enough for 
that!. Abel your a Bouncer, don't let it go to your head and do something 
stupid". "No I mean it", Abel continued getting a little full of himself, "I am 
responsible for those people in that bar. If someone comes in with a knife or a 
gun or whatever, that's my job, I got to handle it". "Yea OK Abel, ...you go 
ahead and save the world... but <U>Deal the Damn Cards</U> !! Gypsy interrupted. 
A word from on high ended the discussion for the moment...Gypsy was the Queen 
Bee of Bunratty's, the ruling social queen of the Heavy Metal scene, if that's 
possible in a bar whose social scene ran at the speed of a universal cocaine 
high. 
<P class=story align=left>Abel was in his prime. I liked Abel, Just about 
everybody in our crowd did. He reminded me of myself in the days when I ran the 
Student Government at college. He was about the only black guy in the bar many 
evenings, but he carried it off well. Somehow he managed to keep a sense of 
himself in the rarefied atmosphere of the soon to be famous Boston Heavy Metal 
scene. He was someone you could genuinely trust, in a crowd of people that 
defined the term outrageous. He took great delight in his new found position of 
social standing, not to mention in the attentions of several of the bars finer 
women. Still, Gypsy's slight seemed appropriate, the status, the drugs, the 
attention and the women had Abel overestimating the situation, or so it seemed 
to me at the time. After all, even tho he had replaced the fisticuffs of the 
previous regime with psych and tact successfully, it was after all still just a 
Biker Bar gone Metal in a non descript backwater of the Boston Scene. The use of 
the term &quot;Responsibility&quot; in the context seemed overplayed for sure. 
<P>
<P class=story align=left>The evening wound down and everyone slowly got 
themselves out the door and I went to sleep. The next evening after the days 
work, I landed again at Buns, for almost three years I never missed a night. It was a 
rocking good night. The place was packed.</P>
<P class=story align=left>I was standing at the end of the Bar away from the 
stage near the door between the slats and the bar when the first shot rang out. 
I have always been blessed with quick reactions to dangerous situations and was 
in a crouch and half way down the bar before most people realized what was 
happening. The band kept playing for the first several shots as the crowd 
started to react ...slowly at first. I looked over my right shoulder across the 
crowd as I made my way down the bars length while the Gunshots continued to ring 
out. Somebody was standing on the entrance landing shooting a gun into the air, 
bullets crashing into the ceiling above the crowd. One shot, two, three and by four I 
was near the end of the Bar and trying to figure out where to go next to avoid 
being trapped in the Men's room. I had no idea what was happening other than 
that it was definitely time to go... During that last quarter of the bars length 
the crowd was now crouching and moving toward the stage in a mass. The people 
looked like stalks of wheat being blown by a ferocious wind all bending and 
moving in the same direction...away from the gunman. One figure, standing 
straight up, his head feet above the crouching crowd, was moving in the opposite 
direction against the crowd and toward the gunman. As he traversed the last ten 
feet he began to hold his hands up in the air, palms open and toward the gunman. 
It is a sight I will never forget. Fortunately for my sleep at night I missed 
what happened next. I was too concentrated on survival to play the tourist on 
this one. Those shots were real and the paced two and three second intervals 
seemed to carry an incredible terrifying threat. 
<P class=story align=left>The Gunman emptied his gun into the ceiling... all 
except for that last shot. As Abel made his way up the landing to confront him, 
feet away from the barking pistol, now alone and standing by himself, James 
Wallace dropped his hand and shot the last rounds directly into Abel's head, then 
left the bar running like the coward he was. James Wallace...the scum... with 
the snout full of co<B>caine murdered Abel, August 1, 1987</B>.</P>
<P class=story align=left>When Abel Harris said "I am my brothers keeper" 
sitting in <U>my</U> living room at sunrise on the very day he was shot...he, 
unlike almost all others who ever uttered that phrase... really meant it.</P>
<P class=story align=left>God be with you Abel.</P>
<P class=story align=left>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=bible align=center>But Cain had words with his brother Abel, and 
when they were out in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him. 
Then the Lord asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He said "I do not know. 
Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>

3:9</P>

<P class=story align=left>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=story align=left>The next morning after spending all night at St 
Elizabeth's Hospital in Alston I wearily returned home but although exhausted 
could not sleep. I called the newspaper and told them what I had seen. The
<a href="AbelShot.htm">
<img border="1" src="../images/AbelPrideQuote.gif" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" width="298" height="156"></a>
reporter had not a clue and the paper was going to just note the event in a 
paragraph on Boston Crime. We talked for about half an hour as the sun came up. 
The reporter mangled most of what I said that morning, or perhaps I did in my 
state of trauma. Buried in the <a href="AbelShot.htm">extensive quotes</a> is one 
of particular interest from our conversation the night before. It is a 
paraphrase of what went on the night before. &quot;I am my brothers keeper... if 
there is a problem in the bar I have to handle it&quot;. The Biblical part of 
the quote was 
dropped, perhaps it seemed unfashionable at the time. Most of the talk over the 
next days was over the last hand Abel had as the guys were trying to goad the 
girls into a round of strip poker at the end of the evening... Aces and Eights. 
Able put the hand down with a laugh and announced &quot;That's it, I'm outta here on 
that one&quot; and everyone left. The evening was over.</P>
<P class=story align=left><i>
<img border="1" src="../images/AbelMinisterQuote_Tmb.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6" width="277" height="288">Numerological Oddity: Wallace shot Abel on August 
1, 1987. FBI records will show that my first call to turn in Dettling, 
in an attempt to&nbsp; prevent additional deaths and "be my brothers keeper", 
occurred August 1, 1995.&nbsp; August 2, 1995, the next day&nbsp; was the Day the Manifesto excerpts 
were first published in the NY Times. That was the day I knew for sure who 
was at the center of the June 20 1992 Bombings and my efforts began in earnest.</i></P>
&nbsp;<P class=story align=center>In both accounts Abel has words with his killer and 
is then later killed. Oddly, I believe other similarities between the Biblical 
story and the Bunratty's murder exist.</P>
