<h1 align="center">Solomon's Women</h1>
<p class="Bible" align="center">King Solomon loved, in addition to the daughter of 
Pharaoh, many foreign woman, Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian and Hittite 
women, from the nations concerning which the Lord had warned the Israelites. 
"You must not cohabit with them, nor they with you, for they will certainly turn 
your hearts to their gods". Solomon held fast to them in love. He had 700 
official wives and 300 concubines....</p>
<p class="BibleRef" align="right">The Holy Bible 1 Kings <b>11</b>:1-3</p><br>
<p class="body" align="center">At Hazor, I remember trying to tell a man who was burdened with 
deep guilt in his personal life and a gripping sense of religion, about what it 
was like to walk off that Tel. When I began to relate the changes in my personal 
life my eyes inevitably widened, my smile broadened, and I probably even giggled 
a little. The harrumph of the committed sounded as he pounced on me with an "I 
have heard just about enough of that". Damnation was on his mind and I was a 
blasphemer. ! </p>
<p class="body" align="center">I went to Gezer in large part because, I could not, 
or did not know how, to get a date. The Allegheny College girl I was chasing 
(Joanne Hanson '74), decided not to go, probably better no Israeli desert than 
one with me. I was smart, Valedictorian at North Yarmouth Academy  prep school (70),... a New England all boys Prep school.
Girls were seen occasionally walking in Yarmouth town. For my Senior Prom my 
aunt arranged a date with Dewsi Wenkler from Connecticut. The same thing all 
Freshman year. I would have arrived at the dig a 19 year old virgin but for a car accident 
the month before with a girl at Pine Point Maine which resulted in virginity's 
loss in the Sun and Gallo wine soaked back seat.</p>
<p class="body" align="center">I walked off Tel Gezer the leanest most
in Fit and thin person I have ever been. That's a 15' x 15' square 20
feet down, with a large Pick, hoe and buckets on ropes in 120 degree
heat and sun. Maybe it was the broadening experience of traveling which
does it for so many,.. but in the days following the dig I began
to suddenly and spectacularly make up for lost time. In a few short
months, I would pass a bakers dozen lovers in the cold weather in
Meadville that year. A series of
affairs with other college travelers was followed by traveling
extensively with a 28 year old, stunning Pre-Med student from Groningen
Holland who was a welcome and wildly exciting tutor,... followed by
Allegheny's class of 1975,... Smart, universally pretty, independent
strong minded,... perfect!</p>
<p class="body" align="center">I returned to Allegheny six weeks after the dig and by March 
1972 was President of the Student Body as a Sophomore and later re-elected as a Junior. Life's sudden torrid pace 
continued. Three partners a week was not uncommon in those years. I was a suddenly a Big Man on Campus in the years 1971-74, the
 peak years of the sexual revolution. 
 Suddenly I was one of its charter members. 
Meadville girls (Townies), then Peace Corps in Belize and hanging with the Reggae 
Bands in British Honduras, wherever I went
life became the pattern of a 20 year old on the hunt. 
The hunt for perfection, in physical beauty, in dynamism, in <b>intellect</b>, and sexuality, 
became an ingrained part of the day. It was always there, unobserved and 
running in the background, dominated and delimited by an overwhelming
desire to please. One encounter left behind just as easily as the next begun. </p><br>

<p class="body" align="center">Then came Peace Corps Thailand.</p>
<p class="body" align="center">When I arrived in Thailand there were 50,000 
American GI's there. Airplane Mechanics, Pilots, support functions for the South 
East Asian Theatre. They had been there for a decade. They were ALL <b>rich</b> 
in Thailand. They were all young and fit in Thailand. They all had at least one 
Minor wife in Thailand. Then the King of Thailand kicked all the GIs OUT OF THAILAND. </p>
<p class="body" align="center"><a href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/ThaiKicked.htm">
<img src="images/ThaiTimes_Tmb.gif" align="left" border="1" height="440" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
width="300"></a>Australia's famous voyage of the courtesans (where a handful of 20 year old sailors transported 200
20ish female British prisoners to Australia) had nothing on 1976 in Bangkok. Suddenly a bawdy Thai 
American community of some
200,000 had its entire male population removed. All the European Men were 
gone.... except for me and my fellow Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
<p class="body" align="center">Peace Corps Thailand had the highest extension rate 
in the World that year. All Men. </p>
<p class="body" align="center">In remote areas at the time you could literally 
gather a crowd of 30 people standing around to hear you talk Thai on a street 
corner when you were just asking directions. Speaking Thai made you the equivalent 
of a Movie star or a Rock Star if you will. </p>
<p class="body" align="center">Speaking Thai gave every Peace Corps volunteer 
there (including me) a social status on the order of a John Wayne... </p>
<p class="body" align="center">My life was again shaped by yet another 
peculiar set of influencing experiences.</p>
<p class="body" align="center">In the years after Thailand  
life's torrid pace continued,... ebbing and flowing with the circumstances 
and the places, and slowly fading with time and age as the decades passed.</p><br>
<p class="body" align="center">Instead of Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian and Hittite 
... it was Japanese, American, Dutch, German, French, Thai, Lao, 
Belizean, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Mexican, British, Irish I think, Brazilian, 
Vietnamese, Korean, Greek, and Chinese.... </p>

</p><p class="BibleRef" align="right"> ...from a regional manager of the Department of Labor to lead singers to waitresses to babes in full heavy metal regalia,...  I loved and cared about nearly each and every.
 I arrived on the doorstep of my elder years, with few strong regrets except for 
 having missed the family life I always really wanted to find. The mysteries, adventures and wonders that have dominated my existence since the Gate, the raw volume of intrigue, is however more than just compensation, all else simply and completely pales.
