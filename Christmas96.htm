	<P class=head align=center>
		Greyhound Bus Station<br>Boulder Colorado<br>December 26,
		1996 12:15 AM<br>Twenty Five Years after King Solomon's Gate
	</P>
	<P align=center>
		<a href="RMNews.html">Rocky Mountain News</a>
	</p>
	<P align=center>It had been a fun day. It was the first family type
		christmas I had had in years. Colorado seemed to be working out. I had
		arrived in late November 1996 to work at US West Yellow pages as a
		software designer on the Sales Application "Wild Thing". James Mac
		Read, a fellow 4th Dimension software designer, had graciously invited
		me to his home to have Christmas dinner with him, his wife and four
		kids. I couldn't help wondering how he managed it all and still found
		time to be a Deacon in his church, and do all the other things he was
		involved in. He was a stereotypical pillar of his community and yet
		had still found the time and compassion to invite a newcomer to the
		community into his home on Christmas day.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>Mac dropped me at the corner in
		Longmont just as the bus arrived towards six o'clock in the evening
		and I rode it into Boulder Colorado for the transfer to Greyhound
		which would take me back to Denver. When the bus arrived, the Denver
		bus had just left and the schedule indicated it would be another hour
		for the next bus.</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>I got bored waiting after a few minutes
		and began to explore the area around the station. I looked for an
		expresso shop diagonally across the road from the station and then
		went to find one. I got back to the station just in time to see the
		bus pull out. I hollered to try to get Drivers attention but he
		ignored me and drove off.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>I checked the schedule and now I had to
		wait until Nine. I passed the time as best I could in the station
		waiting for my bus. As nine came and went the station master told me
		that the bus had been canceled and now I would have to wait for the
		next one just after Midnight. I began to worry about getting enough
		sleep to be at work fresh and on time in the morning.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>My worry started to turn to panic when
		the bus did not show on time. The station master was less than
		sympathetic after a long day, but assured me it "should" be here.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>I paced back an forth, chain smoking
		even more than what was at the time my normal three packs a day.
		Finally the bus arrived and pulled into the station in the fifth or
		sixth bay away from the ticket counter and parked. Apparently the
		driver was taking a break. The bus would be leaving in ten minutes. As
		the time for departure neared, I ran out of matches and wanted one
		last butt before I got on. I made an oddly large number of inquires
		and got turned down by everybody, so I made my way towards the bus
		again, fearful I would screw it up again. As I approached the bus a
		Gaggle of half a dozen people stood in a circle in animated
		conversation and one single lone figure was standing near the bus's
		open door. He had just arrived at the spot. It must have been about
		1:00 AM. The figure was stooped, thin, and a little emaciated, about
		5'11" as I recall. The figure straightened up as I approached and
		turned his head to look at me. As I crossed the last few feet his
		eye's widened in increasing panic. I was "in motion" for the last few
		steps and raised my unlit cigarette, asking "You got a light?". As I
		did so the figures eyes flared wide, his face contorted in fear and
		horror and he let out a drawn out "ohhhhhh Noooooo", his tenor voice
		filled with horror.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>The "vibe" off the man was
		overwhelming. I believe I actually took two steps directly back before
		I turned to walk away thinking "Geez guess I'll get my light
		elsewhere". The encounter left me troubled. Altho I was primarily
		looking at his face and its reaction, in memory,... he was wearing a
		western fleece vest with a shiny red spot in the area just over his
		heart. I wandered off for a minute or two but the bus began to board
		so I did also.</P>
	<P class=Intro align=center>The bus was packed. As I made my way
		back to find a seat I passed Karr(?) sitting on the left side in an
		isle seat about a quarter of the way back, we both reacted with a
		start. I found a seat about half way back on the right side and sat
		down in the Isle seat. Almost immediately he began to look back at me
		over his shoulder, then he averted his gaze as he saw me return it.
		This continued a few times a minute as the bus made its way through
		Boulder. It became increasingly uncomfortable. The Glaring fearful
		furtive looks were major creepy. I remember thinking "What the f*ck is
		this guys problem?". I couldn't figure out why bumming a light would
		create such a reaction, and soon began to wish he would just "go
		away", I was beginning to get angry. (Others on that bus HAD to notice
		this) Then he did. The bus pulled in for a second stop somewhere on
		the outskirts of Boulder. It pulled off the highway into a parallel
		parking area with some commercial type buildings lining the road. With
		a last couple of glances he got up, pulled a small item off the shelf
		(backpack), gave a last fearful furtive look, and made his way off the
		bus to my noticeable relief.</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>I arrived at work the next morning to
		hear conversation about the murder the night before. Mac stopped by my
		cube to talk about it. He asked me if I had "seen anything" and I
		responded that I thought I may have. I did not want to come forward. I
		was involved in a series of issues which would greatly complicate such
		an action and in all probability make it completely fruitless. At
		first I felt it was probably nothing anyway, assuming the time of
		death was late in the night not midnight. I also had no idea, and no
		way of knowing, that the station was actually a short 15 Minute walk
		from the house. If it was the killer, he must have run into me in just
		minutes after leaving the body. Later on, when I learned of the time
		of death, I made half hearted attempts but by then the "Ramsey's did
		it" fix was in and as I expected it was blown off. I don't think they
		even really noticed or even bothered to write down my name.</p>
	<P class=Intro align=center>
		I stated in every interview that followed the arrest of John Mark Karr
		that I could not provide a reliable ID of the individual involved,
		altho many stations cut it. Do I think it was Karr? Actually yes I do,
		but unfortunately, I am no where near sure enough to get on the stand
		and point a finger. Regrettably. The reverse however may not be true,
		if Mr Karr is intent on confession, <b>identifying my jacket,
			clothing, or the distinctive shoes I was wearing that day, would
			prove his case...</b><br> <br>In the topsy turvy mirror world
		of events related to the Gate,<br> it somehow almost makes sense
		that the witness is depending on the perpetrator for an identification<br>Time
		will tell.

		<b>Update: Oct 17 2006</b> Watching the same stone faced Karr clips
		over and over never produced an image. Watching Greta's interview Oct
		16th did. The image "filled in" when his raised eyebrow expression two
		minutes into the interview matched the expression I saw. I had an
		undeniable "flash" of recognition. It is a ten year old memory of a
		moment in time, seconds really... it is a weak memory admittedly, but
		I am as sure of it now as it is possible to be under the
		circumstances. Time will tell, I believe this is not over yet.

		<b>Update: Sept 2008: </b>Hallelujah! Touch DNA has now proved that
		there was an intruder, that the intruder did murder her, that he was
		bleeding! We now will someday know the truth of these matters, it is
		only a matter of time. Karr fled the country at the news, interesting,
		very interesting. My heartfelt thanks and congratulations to the
		investigators,... keep up, get fired up, DONT STOP!

		<b>Secondary Event:</b> Karr's Natalie Wood/Miracle on 34th street
		obsession becomes a bit of a mind-bender if you think about it.
		Definitely a "secondary event"... Karr focuses on a Movie about a
		little girl and Christmas which is about proving the unprovable, (the
		existence of Santa). The Christmas murder that is his motivation
		becomes part of the events surrounding the first Biblical Proof,
		proving the unprovable (the existence of God). Its parallel being the
		slaughter of innocence on Christmas (Herod).

	<P align=Center>
		At the end of this latest episode in the Ramsey murder a <b>Gag
			Order</b> was issued to stop discussion of the Video Surveillance tape
		from the Bus Station. Why? Has this tape also been Lost and the Gag
		Order a coverup for incompetence?... or does the existence of the Gag
		order confirm that a tape exists and something is on it? If so, why is
		the publics attention not being directed at identifying the
		individual? Why a Gag Order? Supporting <a

	<P align=Center>
		Eleven years after child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey was brutally
		murdered in her own home, experts are making the shocking charge that

		<b>Update: Oct 2014: </b>Recent email exchanges with someone
		interested in the case (Laurie S SimpleB...Gmail) has resulted in
		further information. The party mentioned Karr's "Odd Body Type" being
		somewhat dwarfish with short legs and long body. I didn't actually
		slap myself in the forehead and yell "BINGO", but easily could have.
		For years I have been describing an "odd stooped posture, kind of like
		he was stooping down not to be seen". No it wasn't a stoop I saw I
		realize now, it was Karr's very odd elongated body and short legs I
		saw. No Question About It. I always used the word "odd" to describe
		the stance because there was always something that literally "didn't
		fit",... til now.

		The <a href="Christmas96a.htm">original story</a> was posted in 2002
		(Unabom site) and extensively updated in jan 2004 after it was
		announced DNA had been recovered. At that point I assumed an arrest
		would eventually be made and wanted to make the details as clear as I
		could at that time in anticipation of any possible arrest. Prior to
		that time I had attempted to be cryptic thus the poem, the
		outrageousness of the events was getting to me at the time. This page
		is being added so as not to alter the original file. The original
		description was off in several respects, the momentary image "filled
		in" after I had the flash of recognition at his fearful facial
		expression during the Greta interview. Much of the description is an
		unconscious attempt to reconcile the odd posture, a confusing image,
		until I was informed of his dwarfish qualities 18 years later.

		<b>Footnote:</b> As staggering an admission of stupidity as it is... I
