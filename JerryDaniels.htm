		<b>On meeting Jerry Daniels</b>
	</p>
	<P>
		It would seem odd that I would spring to Jerry Daniels Defense. It
		probably requires clarification. He was a very brave man. He saw his
		government engaged in dishonorable behavior toward the friends he had
		promised so much, and he brilliantly,... <i>single handedly</i>,...
		corrected the Injustice.
	</P>
	<P>Much of what I know of Jerry Daniels is from his mouth, the rest
		is from a volunteer I replaced, and the incredible respect shown him
		by the tribe of starving Hmong (Montegard) in Ampur Loei refugee camp,
		Loei Thailand. They were looking to him for a way out of the nightmare
		in the summer of 1976.</P>
	<P>
		I guess its a little irresistible not to start at the beginning. Peace
		Corps started out real interesting in the village of Mae Jon, but the
		guerilla activity in the three counties of Mae Jon, Mae Saei and in
		particular in Ching San along the Lao border required my relocating
		to Chang Rai. Moving from a house with six inch spiders whom you could
		hear coming on the rough teak floor (woke you up) (tap tap tap kinda
		like "with fava beans") to the relative luxury of the Chang Rai Hotel.
		Old but still colonial elegance by comparison. Trips to the field got
		scarce with the Agricultural agents preferring to hang at the County
		Seat. With little to do but play the guitar poorly, read history of
		American foreign policy in South East Asia (Best and Brightest back to
		Truman), and take Aussie Junkies <IMG alt="Akha Woman in Village"
			align=right border=0 src="images/Akha.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10">
		on junket for walks in the hills to meet the Akha ...junkets to
		Bangkok every first to get and spend the paycheck were a real
		highlight.
	</P>
	<P>On one of these trips to the RongRam Liberty (Liberty Hotel near
		Klong Thoy) I was told of a job opening that required both Thai,
		Hmong, English and American bureaucracy skills that paid a literal
		fortune and was supposed to be a little exciting. I applied and
		interviewed with Lionel Rosenblatt and was hired.</P>
	<P>I had spent the last year reading about various aspects of
		American Foreign policy in South East Asia and now I was suddenly
		working in a refugee evacuation next the former head of AID Cambodia.
		When Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia went down that only left Thailand and
		Malaysia as the ASEAN bureaucratic unit. Bosses I read about were now
		file clerks, bored and choc-a full of gossip about what was really
		happening, and block-a full of what had happened.</P>
	<P>There was really only one game left in town if you were
		human...get your people out.</P>
	<P>Army wanted the Vietnamese colonels out, AID fought for the
		Cambodians, and the CIA wanted the Hmong. Congress wanted as few as it
		took to look good as long as it did not include the primitive Hmong.
		The "Jungle" folks would never fit in went congressional thinking by
		all local reports.</P>
	<P>The arguments raged. No Hmong was blatant racism and an easy
		mark for the politically savvy spooks. By the numbers and divide was
		what was fair. It looked good until they saw the numbers. Too many
		Hmong still. The trap of their own prejudice was masterfully laid.
		"Your right, we can do that with a test, primitivos get the boot,
		democracy's face is saved, see it was really fair after all (politely
		ignoring the fact that the whole tribe got massacred for saving so
		many American lives and always keeping their word).</P>
	<P>Ok, so lets see how do we do this. Lets do it by points like a
		school grade card. Ah Points if you been to America, that should help
		the second time, Language is going to be tough, points for each non
		primary language fluency ...a bonus for English, oh and of course job
		skills, after all we want taxes out of these folks in five years not
		welfare.</P>
	<P>The Hmong all trained at camp some name or other in the US, many
		several times for updated spook courses on something or other related
		to killing your fellow man. The Hmong occupied the hilltops and had to
		speak the languages of all sides to survive. Hmong, Chinese, French,
		Lao and of course English. Then there were all those courses at
		American bases on things like Vehicle Maintenance...by the time they
		added up the points there were about three PRA numbers left for the
		Vietnamese ...war hero's with a rank of colonel or above :)</P>
	<P>Congress Freaked. Viet's X, Cambodian's Y Hmong's Z (11,000) end
		of discussion, end of embarrassing episode, end of thinking challenges
		to current political Theocracy. DO IT.</P>
	<P>I can't remember the name of the guy I replaced but I only met
		him once in a Restaurant for lunch in a busy noisy Thai market. He was
		heading out country as I recall. He was a friend of the brunet I had a
		crush on who introduced me to Lionel Rosenblatt and got the me Job in
		the first place. (Linda?). His nerves had broke and he wanted out. The
		job description included twice weekly trips up a long dirt road to
		Ampur Loei right in the crook of the Mekong to organize and load
		busses of refugees for the trip to Bangkok. Gunfire was frequent in
		that area. Busses were getting hit. and then he started to tell me
		about having to ride with that guy sometimes into the camp ... "that
		who ?"...there was obvious awe in his voice.</P>
	<P>"I don't really know who he is, but this guys too god damned
		important to be sharing a cab with on the road to Loei". He said as I
		recall. He had a point...good instincts...quite sharp as I recall. I
		think I was daydreaming/flirting with Linda at the time and it sort of
		registered :)</P>
	<P>He started to tell me the story of the agenda and I started to
		pay attention. He was a dumb shit volunteer just like me. Except he
		never got to talk to someone like himself. 100 percent green. Out of
		TEFL* I think, one of those Bangkok volunteers who mostly spoke
		English. He shows up at the camp trying to get folks organized.
		Everybody's listless he isn't quite sure what's going on but can't
		quite get folks in line. According to his account he looked up and saw
		the Ambassadors Limo roaring into camp with both flags waving and out
		jumps Jerry Daniels. He'd grabbed the car, the man was away by tale.
		Fluent Hmong, action and reaction like a spring and its hustle hustle
		hustle, papers in a line and now quiet.</P>
	<P>He had spent the entire morning just trying to explain what he
		wanted and get everybody in line with their papers and they did it
		automatically themselves in five minutes flat at the sight of Jerry
		Daniels. He said "I had no idea who he was, I just looked at him and said What do you want me to do"? Jerry Daniels, former Montana Smoke Jumper, was now in charge of allocating the PRA numbers.</P>
	<P>
		Mr. and Mrs. Xiong with nine kids first in Line. Dejection then polite
		worried smile and they leave. Back and fro and its always the two kids
		to the front. Mr. Xong, wife maiden Xiong, no kids and
		"kablam...stamp...smile". In that one critical day Jerry Daniels saved
		what was left of the people he came to help. <IMG alt="Hmong Tribes"
			align=left border=1 src="images/hmong.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10">
		In three years its PRA status (Permanent Resident Alien) for the
		couple, and automatic visas for the Xongs, and for the Xiongs, ...and
		on and on it went. PRA relatives are eligible in three years for PRA,
		and then the relatives of the relatives and on it goes. <B>Oskar
			Schindler had a list... and Jerry Daniels had a chain letter</B>. Three
		thousand PRA's today became 90,000 a few years later because Jerry
		Knew his people, their family's, who was related to who etc et al. He
		faced death too. In a way that's not for money.
	</P>
	<P>
		Anyway, I had to meet this guy. Not sure, but I think I started on a
		Tuesday and was introduced to Corvalier. The French Tyrant. This was
		at the heart a file clerk business, whatever went on in the field.
		Corvalier was the epitome of the rule of the chief file clerk, pure
		terror. But you had to get through the time in the Bangkok office
		before they let you anywhere near the field. WHO's (World Health
		Organization Documents) protected the clerks, as well as the Americans
		at the other end. Corvalier was legend. In Chile, after Allende, he moved ten thousand
		refugees out in three months starting from scratch. Now he had tea
		every afternoon with the French ambassador and returned at the end of
		the day for the ceremonial three questions. You had to know everything
		to be safe. Miss one and its the slide back to Hoboken looming in the
		horizon. By the end of the week it was a crisis in photos and matching
		up and finding the right Xiong. I spent the weekend organizing
		hundreds of photos, <B>writing the <I>name on the back of the
				photos</I>,<I> which were later pasted onto Transit, Visa and WHO
				documents</I>.
		</B> I got everything nice and orderly and got myself bumped quick to the
		Nong Kai embassy to start taking out eleven hundred Hmong refugees
		from Loei. In a real war I guess you would have called me a
		replacement. The couple with the Southern Accent opposed the quickness
		saying I wasn't paperwork qual'd yet, but it was needed now. I moved
		into a spacious bungalow in Nong Kai with a bar and a housekeeper and
		a shower and a car and a driver and a gate and a wall around it and
		heavy bureaucrats dealing with devastation in their careers and all
		around.
	</P>
	<P>Papers and busses were organized at the Nong Kai office.
		Transport was requested and assigned. Usually a Thai taxi driver
		(Lon?). I made the trip from Nong Kai to Loei with Daniels several
		times and drank with him occasionally at a bar whose porch overhung
		the Mekong. Once a body from the Cambodian massacres going on just
		across the river floated past smelling badly. In the restaurants and
		bars and over games of snooker he told me his version of the story of
		his life and it is largely that which I impart.</P>
	<P>
		He said he had grown up in Montana and was working as a smoke jumper
		on forest fires when he got an offer to do Air transport in Laos of
		medical supplies to remote villages. He did it for years and kept at
		it because he liked the people and the adventure. They became his
		friends. When the Vietnamese came through, the Hmong were the only
		unallied group they could pick on, so they did. Murder and forced
		service became the order of the day at the hands of the Pathet Lao. He
		was already flying in guns purchased with Hmong money for their
		defense, when the CIA offered them for free. At the end of the war the
		company wanted him to go to Africa which was supposed to be the next
		hot spot for spook super spies in 1976. He declined. Abandoning
		friends at their darkest hour to climb a corporate ladder just wasn't
		in his playbook. He assisted Vang Pao in liquidating certain
		properties and helicopters and bought the ranch south of Missoula to
		get the tribe landed in the new land. Why Missoula ? His only
		relative, a niece (?) was sponsored by Daniels mother <A name=Eulogy></A>at
		U of M Missoula and therefore that is where he went. It was his only
		living relative in the US. That story alone kind of makes me believe
		him, let alone the reverence shown him by Ly Teng among others. <A
			href="JerryDanielsEulogy.htm">But who knows</A> I could have just
		been a dumb shit volunteer who got snowed, it was very confusing at
		the time, but I doubt it.
	</P>
	<P>
		The first time I met him was on the four hour ride to the refugee
		camp. When the taxi driver turned up the dirt road to the camp still
		some two plus hours away yet, he scrunches down in the back seat and
		tells me to do the same. "Don't keep any part of your head above the
		line of sight, lots of snipers around here..." he says. I scotched
		REAL low as the taxi bumped along the rough dirt road... Two six
		footers coiled in a back seat bumping heads on a rough dirt road for
		two hours...and he's telling stories all the time. The Hmong at the
		end of the war in Laos get pushed across the border into Thailand who
		doesn't want them and categorizes them as an invading army. Surrender
		your guns or go or war. I was in those camps. Nothing but a few Men,
		mostly women and children were what was left. The UN offered to feed
		the refugees, the Thais said it had to go through them and then stole
		all the money. The Vietnamese kept sending zapper squads over the
		border with machine guns after the refugees trying to gather bamboo
		shoots to eat while defending themselves with crossbows... cause the
		Thais took all the weapons..., then the money..., then the food. The
		bamboo shoots closest to the camp went first. They also shot up busses
		sometimes on the way out. There were three roads out I had to choose
		from, then it was luck. About that point we arrive at the village to a
		warm welcome. We are ushered into a lodge inside the camp walls where
		I am first introduced to <A href="JerryDanielsLyTeng.htm">Colonel
			Ly Teng</A> whom I would work with. I was famished with the long ride,
		the heat and the fear as we sat with a dozen Hmong around a long
		square table. I started to devour the chicken and he nudged me in the
		ribs. I looked up to see others just picking. I ate a small portion
		which would have been a feast to any of my hosts that day and am
		embarrassed about it to this day. He told me later it was one of only
		three chickens left in the entire camp. I was really just the bus man
		checking off names on a list to be sure everybody got on board with
		what was needed but I guess I looked like a little more than that to
		them at the time. I was the bus man on the bus to America. I probably
		looked as good as Moses to those with a ticket to the promise land,
		but they all knew who was the Real Moses in their world, Jerry was
		leading their exodus whether Washington liked it or not.
	</P>
	<P>
		Killed in a <A href="JerryDanielsDeath.htm">drug deal</A> in Bangkok,
		maybe, it was the Hmong occupation for centuries and money is hard to
		come by on the loosing end of a war. Purely for personal profit, I
		don't know, but I doubt it. How would you pay a guy enough to do what
		he did. The possibility that he was murdered <A
			href="http://www.smokejumpers.com/smokejumper_magazine/item.php?articles_id=299&amp;magazine_editions_id=19">over
			the denial of refugee status</A> during the enterprise in which we were
		both involved, I find troubling. I never carried a gun in his
		presence, but I had an instinct that said he was the right guy to have
		along if it ever came to that. Mel Gibson got him <U>just</U> <U>right</U>
		in his portrayal, (based in part I understand on Daniels life) in the
		movie "Air America". He described himself as a Montana Cowboy, and
		when I later spent time there and got to know it, I saw what he meant.
		Different time Different place Different cast... but he was still a
		Bitterroot Rancher talking about the Bankers back east.... He seemed a
		good guy to me.
