Overall, the left testicle shows dimensions of 4.2 x 1.7 x 1.8 cm.  The upper pole portion measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  The lower pole portion measures 2.8 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm.  There is little vascular signal within the testicle.  There is no evidence of a hydrocele.  The right testicle measures 4.9 x 2.7 x 3.0 cm and shows only a tiny quantity of adjacent fluid.  The epididymides  show a normal appearance.  There is no evidence of a significant hydrocele.  <br><br>IMPRESSION:<br>1.  Stable abnormal appearance of the left testicle with a bilobed configuration and greatly diminished internal vascular signal.  The findings appear to be related to a prior infarct.  <br><br>Thank you for referring your patient to Olympic Radiology.<br><br>Signed By: STEVEN A BELL MD<br></body></html>
