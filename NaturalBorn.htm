		There's a Jean Luc Solomon and a Saratoga California conviction,...
		that tells me there will be a lot more too, when I have the time to
		look. Staggering. Of course no one will believe it, but perhaps
		Charles will remember the Peace Corps Volunteer in the Summer of 1976
		who he drugged in a Hotel Room in Bangkok (He is still alive). The
		Peace Corps Volunteer flush with Cash from working the Refugee
		evacuation looking for an investment opportunity that Marie talked
		into buying Hmong embroideries to sell in Paris. The Volunteer who
		made an excuse, a ruse really, and staggered quickly to his room and
		locked and barred the Door. The one who passed out for a day and a
		half, and woke up to find Charles and his Lady long gone along with
		her trunks full of handicrafts and Gems.</p>

	<P class=quote>As close as I can place the event, it would have
		been during my training period for I.C.E.M. (International Committee
		for European Migration) in Bangkok, the hotel was not the Liberty nor
		any of the Pat Pong dives. It must have been the one I stayed in while
		working at the ICEM office (Corvalier's Office) during the first week
		or so of my ICEM training. I had just cashed my return Peace Corps Air
		ticket. May or June of 1976 would be about right. They may have just
		returned from Malaysia and the murder of Chowdbury, on their way to
		Geneva with their Gems... I recall the talk of Gems from the last
		evenings conversation in their room, as Marie tutored me in the
		economics of the Handicraft trade and the Mickey started to make me
		woozy. They were leaving the country the next day as I recall. I saw
		their pictures in the International Herald Tribune to my great shock
		one day in a Kathmandu "Tea" shop on Freak Street several months later
		and have thought of it ever since.</p>
	<P class=quote>I remember her far more than him, there was
		something almost motherly about her, she seemed to genuinely care
		(...oops). In the endless parade of murderers and rogues that
		comprised Bangkok at the time of the Cambodian Refugee evacuation, I
		had barely noticed him. My alerts went off for some reason just
		moments before I passed out, to this day I can not remember what
		triggered them and saved my life.</P>
	<P class=quote>
		Their murder spree ended with the case of Jean Luc <b>Solomon</b>
		because they dosed the victims too much and they passed out too
		soon,... in the lobby of the Hotel in front of witnesses. It is an
		irony I still consider and will always wonder about, did my encounter
		play a role? That Charles still lives is a miscarriage of justice to
		all his victims. In the end its a personal thing, would you want the
		man who murdered you to be walking the planet for years bragging of
		his exploits to reporters and cameras enjoying his fame bought with
		your life? An eye for an eye is the only justice for murder.
