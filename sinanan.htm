		<h1 style="margin-top: 0px;">Beware</h1>
		<div style="width: 900px;">
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;">I went to Dr Mika N Sinanan, MD to
				fix a prior University of Washington Hernia operation by Dr Andrew
				Wright in Nov of 2011 which had failed. The first failure was due to
				my not ceasing supplements which causing excessive bleeding, a
				nurses faulty instruction's that continuing to take fish oil and
				DHEA was not a problem, and again my fault, an excessive use of a
				sledge hammer. The prior operation had left an extremely large
				scrotal hematoma (blob of dried blood the size of a toy football
				2x3x5") which was by then rapidly disappearing without
				complications. I had seen three other physicians at UW including
				Wright about the hematoma just after the first operation and been
				told by all three to leave it alone in the strongest terms. A fourth
				I saw in Israel, just before the second operation, just after the
				reoccurrence, Dr. Oded Olsha of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in
				Jerusalem, said in a general conversation about it "for gods sake
				you don't want to do that...." (try to surgically remove the
				hematoma - at that point, Sept 2013, thumb size 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5).
				Boy was he right. He indicated there was a chance of infection but
				it would probably go away on its own given its current state, and if
				infected should be addressed with antibiotics until it resolved.
				Over the next three months it further reduced by a third and was
				totally asymptomatic.</p>
			<p>
				During the patient doctor conference to fix the returned hernia
				Sinanan made a real show at the start, repeatedly staring at the
				chalkboard, repeatedly pausing, and looking very pained for what
				seemed like minutes. It actually created a sympathy reaction in me.
				I had read he was not only Medical Director of the facility, but one
				of the "50 GREATEST DOCTORS ON EARTH", so I felt privileged to be
				there and a bit unworthy to be there with a run of the mill hernia.
				I was also worried about the negative reactions my obstinate
				decision to refuse to go back to Wright and switch surgeons had
				seemed to create in the hospital. One nurse had gone so far as to
				say the operation was really "beneath his skill level",... another
				had subtly tried to steer me to another surgeon. Wright had also
				contacted me to dissuade me from the change, sounding quite pained.
				But I had been so personally uncomfortable with Wright (<u>nothing</u>
				to do with medical issues, I just did not like the feel of his
				touch down there, it did not feel clinical to me but personal and made me intensly uncomfortable), 
				that I had delayed the initial procedure by three years to
				my detriment, before deciding that this was UW, and I should get
				over it. After the first disaster, I could
				not bring myself to do it again. Most would have gone elsewhere I
				guess, I had a misplaced faith in the institution that had saved my
				life in 1996 (but it was a person who saved my life in 1996 not an institution).
				When asked for an alternative, James Schrom had pushed
				Sinanan, saying if I was willing to wait I could get the very best. 
				So to each I gave the instructed reply that I really didn't mind
				waiting. So in a reaction to Sinanan's obvious, demonstrative,
				expressive difficulty, I said "well don't worry about it (explaining
				the technical details of hernia surgery to me), I know you are one
				of the very best so just do what is best for my health, I am not
				going to second guess you on how to fix a hernia". I had a hernia,
				he fixed hernias, it needed to be fixed. I had tried and failed to
				understand the biomechanics of hernias several times already without
				result anyway. My statement got a big smile and a rapid movement
				toward the door which took me by surprise. I had not intended to end
				the conversation. Then, already half way out the door, he said "Oh
				yea and we will get that hematoma too". That stunned me, I had
				considered it a closed matter for a year, and it was almost gone by
				then anyway. "Really?" I said in questioning shock not approval. He
				responded "There's absolutely no reason not to now" and was
				hurriedly gone before I could utter a word. The entire patient
				doctor conference took less than three minutes, actually, I think,
				less than two, before he bolted out the door. The pained pantomime
				took the first 90 seconds. It left me confused. I don't remember him
				even looking at the now thumb sized, rapidly shrinking, hematoma in
				any detail. I never got the chance to tell him that it had gone down
				by a third in the last three months and felt fine. I intended to
				talk to him before the surgery in light of the strong unanimous
				warnings by four Doctors, but before I realized it was tranquilized
				and in the confusion of surgery day, <b>on a Saturday morning,
					Jan 5, 2013 at 8 am</b>, missed the opportunity to bring it up.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Absolutely no reason not too...<b><em>now</em></b>"
			</p>
			<p>I woke up with a testicle the size of a large grapefruit that
				did not go down for six months. I left my software developer
				position at Intel and have been out of work for a year at this
				point. Dr Olsha had also said that "you don't want to do that cause
				it will never be right". That has also proven to be true. I am left
				with a hard and painful lump of coal where there was once something
				I was quite fond of. UW has saved my life twice. I revered the
				hospital, I always went there for twenty years, and always with
				excellent results. On two occasions I traveled from the east coast
				so I could have procedures at UW. My trust in the institution was
				without bounds or question. Only now do I realize that "50 GREATEST
				DOCTORS ON EARTH" is a title for the politically powerful, not a
				measure of healing skill. Schweitzer he ain't. The hernia surgery
				was so far competent, but my life has been devastated for from what
				I can tell is no good reason, in a procedure I did not request, to
				my knowledge clearly consent to, nor understand.</p>
			<p>The worst thing about the operation is it turned me from a
				vigorous Man who ran five miles a day and lived life to the hilt to
				a very very old man who feels quite weak and frail. I reference two
				facial photos of me here one 3 Months before and one three months
				after. I estimate it will cost me at least ten years of life*, and
				what I do get is now nothing like the fun life used to be. Like I
				said, beware, I feel like I was mugged.
			<p>
				<br> <a href="sinananreport.htm">Medical Evaluation</a><br>
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>* In the weeks before the second operation it had gotten so
				small and light it had moved out of the scrotal sac and moved or
				risen up underneath the skin flap above, in short it was rapidly
				being cleansed from my body without intervention as all four other
				Doctors had predicted, some as recently as three months before they
				rolled me into Sinanan's chamber and changed my life forever...</p>

			<p>***While I am still trying to understand the medical records,
				it appears that in the absence of any evidence of infection the
				Insurance Company has refused to pay for the procedure and the
				hospital has "adjusted" the balance. I am currently seeking, so far
				unsuccessfully, a Medical Malpractice attorneys assistance. If you
				are a willing attorney please Email Webmaster@KingSolomonsGate.com</p>
			<p>
				**** During scheduling, a nurse overheard a discussion instructing
				me on the checkin procedures on a <b>Saturday</b> and reacted with a
				shocked comment, ("On a Saturday,your kidding me, who ever operates
				on a Saturday") the other responded <i>"Oh that's just a Sinanan
					thing.."</i>, in an odd sort of "hush hush" manner. I wonder about that
				comment to this day in light of <a
					href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980308&slug=2738456">recent
					newspaper articles on Sinanan</a>. ( <a
					href="SinananDrMarchioroDeath.pdf">PDF</a> ). Note: The PDF copy
				will not vanish from the web like the others.

			<h1>The Nurse</h1>
			<p>
				Right in the middle of a compile the phone rang. the 4d masterpiece
				was headed for a room with corporate bigwigs in hours. Another
				problem with the back end needing something that they hadn't figured
				on needing from my Flash/Flex front end, and I was scrambling to
				damn sure my compatriots looked good. The definition of insanity is
				making code changes on the very day of a Fortune 500 Board
				presentation. It was the nurse to schedule my surgery. I tried to
				focus despite the pressure. She named a day by which I was sure they
				weren't going to be ready. Oh Sorry Garry. Excuse me,... burp. I
				tried to push for more time, but of course I still wanted it as soon
				as possible. The hernia was a pain in the arse and I wanted to get
				back to running, and hopefully lifting weights again (Oh for a stair
				master). Swimming three miles a day was getting old too. Apparently
				the surgery wasn't for five days afterwards, this was just a
				meeting. Saved I thought. We will do it on Skype. The voice on the
				other end became brittle as steel in the arctic. Oh I said, do we
				have to do tests? No. Why a live meeting for Christ's sake, its
				going to cost me 500 extra for the motel and I would have to abandon
				my friend at a critical part of the development cycle. I pushed
				mercilessly, more than I had a right too. We settled on a face to
				face two days out and I promised to read the manuals and then over
				pressured for time did not. At the meeting there was ABSOLUTELY
				nothing that could not have easily been handled on time over Skype,
				but it was one leap to far for an over pressured and I would say
				scared nurse. I continued to take supplements, specifically DHEA and
				Fish oil which makes me bleed for a half hour from a shaving knick.
				I got to the conference which I had pushed for two days before the
				surgery, to discover my error at the aspirin question. I told her
				the problem, and did feel like a jerk. No aspirin but the other two.
				She asked "No aspirin?", tiny beads of sweat on her forehead from
				the pressure. No I said. She seemed under a lot of pressure. But
				what about the Fish Oil I said, now belatedly remembering reading
				about it. She waved her hand and said as long as no aspirin no
				problem, it didn't sound right, in the presentation let alone the
				facts, I asked again about the two, was it Ok to keep taking them
				even now two days out, to cover herself I think, she said no
				problem,... so I went with it. I remember the day of the surgery
				looking at the caps of DHEA and Fish oil, shrugging and saying "well
				she says it ok". The DHEA Fish Oil effect is very short lived, it
				was the last day or two that did it, and I knew better despite what
				I had been told. My guess the root problem is in the
				institutionalized fear, I pushed more than is wise, A personalities
				sometimes do. But the next time a guy with a knife posts a sign with
				"50 GREATEST ON EARTH", run like hell, I should have spotted that
				one from a mile off, and am embarrassed at my naivete <br> <br>I
				have noticed several very bitter patient complaints on major sites
				which have disappeared. I am anxious to contact and possibly assist
				those individuals, and the next poor joe walking through that door.
				Contact: webmaster@kingsolomonsgate.com. If you found this looking
				for Doctor reviews,... be aware, the major review sites are quite
				obviously scrubbed, at least if you have enough power anyway. If you
				get an offer of a surgery on a Saturday with no cameras, no students
				and no witnesses, my advice would be one of extreme caution.

				<b>Postscript - My Opinion</b> - From my personal experience, it is
				my belief that what we have here is a criminal, one who like a
				pedophile priest hides behind his respectability, performing
				admirably, even saving lives, until he decides to indulge himself in
				his petty pleasures, which for him are the real objective, the
				sought reward, the true purpose behind a seemingly admirable
				dedication and talent. It is a too common trait in those who seek
				and find power. The widow of his <a
					href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980308&slug=2738456">now
					dead fellow surgeon</a>. ( <a href="SinananDrMarchioroDeath.pdf">PDF</a>
				) seemed notably unforgiving and bitter in her discussion of her
				husbands death coming off from Sinanan's operating table. For her,
				it does not sound like that suit was about the money (see excerpt
				below). The news coverage, in light of my personal experience, makes
				me wonder if there is more to the story. It is a phenomenon that is
				common in modern society, the Bill Cosby's of the world are more
				numerous than we want to believe, and that is why it is so easy for
				them to rise to heights, and hide in plain site, aided and abetted
				by our universal and misplaced desire to believe in universal
				goodness. What Sinanan did to me was criminal by my definition of
				the word. When you see that sort of thing even once, life tells me
				its unlikely that its unique. I would have greatly preferred to have
				been viciously attacked by a mugger on the street. That the legal
				system takes a trick of words and manipulation and refuses to even
				consider any action tells you that there is no real legal recourse
				in these situations, and individuals so inclined rein free, cloaked
				in clever slight of hand and protected by a legal system that
				clearly does not work. How would you feel if you went in, full of
				trust, with a hernia,... and....

			<p style="text-align: center">Excerpt from Times Article on
				Marchioro Death</p>
			<p>
				<small>Further dissection into the mediastinum (interior
					chest) would have risked injury to the heart, to the coronary
					artery bypass grafts, and certainly would have exposed all these to
					an active infection," Sinanan said in court documents.<br> Ron
					Perey, attorney for Karen Marchioro, will tell the court that there
					is nothing in Tom Marchioro's medical record documenting his
					alleged statements about not entering the chest. Such notations are
					required by hospital and state regulations, he says.</br> Perey will
					also cite one medical study saying there is a 15 percent risk of
					heart rupture when the sternum is left open. He will say the
					doctors should have removed the scar tissue that pulled Marchioro's
					heart apart, they should have performed other procedures to
					stabilize the sternum, or they should have kept Marchioro
					immobilized in the intensive care unit until his sternum could be
					closed. <br> Karen Marchioro, trained as a registered nurse,
					cannot accept that her husband would have given instructions that
					would have endangered him. "If he ever had any reservations about
					(going into his chest) he never told me about them," she said in an
					interview.

		<p>Sinanan is a turkish term which translates as "The Test".</p>
		<br>
		<div style="width: 900px;">
			<p>A Surgeon at UW, I don't know who yet, in 1996 saved my life
				with a then experimental procedure called an angioplasty. It was a
				miracle and restored me to full health immediately after my first
				heart attack. It was performed in a lounge chair kind of setup not
				on a table. He had a crewcut, when I woke up and looked at him. I
				was terrified at the realization of what was actually happening at
				that moment, seeing the wire in my artery on the monitor, and in passing peripherally noted to my surprise that
				he was smoking. He saw I was awake and the lights went out in
				seconds. I note only the coincidence that Marchioro both had a crew
				cut and was a chain smoker. I note this, altho it seems like the wrong specialty, this will be edited when I know.</p>
			<p>
				*Odd Coincidence - One of my favorite expression for years has been
				'I'd give my left nut for that' or 'to see that'. <br>I think I
				said it that News Years eve to Bob and Marva Clark. <br>That
				was the last time I said that with a smile.
