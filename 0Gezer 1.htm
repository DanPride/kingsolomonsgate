<H1 align=center>Selling Provenance<br>Funding Israeli Archaeological Research with its refuse. </H1>
<H1 align=center>A Proposal to the Israeli Antiquities Authority</H1>
<br>
<br>
<P class=intro align=center>Currently Israeli archaeology discards tons of featureless potsherds which are considered valueless by all in their current state. Potsherds of this type are currently being sold by the kilo as pavement filler for a fraction of an agar-ah each.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>It is proposed to redirect the sale of these same sherds at a new rate of several dollars per sherd, generating the increased value by adding  provenance to the sherds and selling them over the world wide web.</P>
<P class=intro align=center>In reality it is not the currently worthless sherds that it is proposed to sell and promote but the history of Israel itself and the connection of people all over the world to that history.</p>
<P class=intro align=center>Featured products would range from Individual items such as the handle of a Jar that "Joshua may have drank from",... to sets of christmas tree ornamental stars with the names of the prophets inscribed on each shard. </p>
<P class=intro align=center>
Each item sold would include accessible on-line Israeli Antiquities authority authorized documentation of its appropriate historical connection of time and place. Only IAA approved excavations and sources would be allowed to list items for sale and only shards from documented strata would be eligible for listing.</p>

<H1 align=center>Advantages</h>
<P class=intro align=center><table cellspacing=10><tr><td>1</td><td>
Generating millions of dollars in funding to expand and professionalize Israeli archaeological research</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>
Create a self funding mechanism to support excavations. Due to the anticipated volume of demand, the more you dig the more funds you generate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>
Create a vast industry wide Oracle based data source of Pottery data which is cross tel, query-able, and freely available to all approved IAA entities</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>
Positively influence and promote israeli tourism. The simple process of examining the location and provenance of ornaments and the associated displayed images on the world wide web will inevitable suggest to many a trip to Israel.</td></tr>
