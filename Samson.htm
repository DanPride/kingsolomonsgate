					It was a moment of Indecision. Maybe I was taking this Daniel and
					the Lions Den thing a little too far. An Archaeological Vacation
					touring Roman sites in a British van was one thing, but did I
					really want to push this thing to the point of driving through the
					Syrian and Jordanian sites to get to Israel... with "Solomonic
					Express" written accross the side? <a name="Samson2"> </a> I Threw
					a sign on the Truck while I spent three days on the Greek Beach
					considering the Issue. But, I really did want to see Amon Ben Tor's
					face as I drove up in a British Tasty Treat Van,... after all, ever
					since Sir Flinders Petri measured the Pyramids dressed in a Pink
					Totu, stuff like this has been an honored archaeological tradition.
				</p>
				<p class="quote">I read a short random passage about Samson,
					during an afternoon on the beach. It struck me as an oddly fitting
					character to read about, sitting on the outskirts of Thessalonica.
					The Greek sun was worthy of a Grade B Movie, and I was headed to
					excavate at Hazor. Tel Hazor's history is dominated by the time of
					the Judges, like the historical Samson. I kept hoping fate would
					take a hand and save me from my own determination to drive all the
					way there.</p>
				</p> <a name="Samson6"> </a>
				<p class="quote">No Takers after three days and then I decided to
					go to a church to decide. A Little Old Lady looked at me with
					wizened but very wide eyes saying "You Papa You Papa" whilst
					standing in front of an Golden Iconic Panting of Steven(?)... I
					walked out of the church, into the truck, and started to drive
					around the End of the Mediterranean***.</p>
				<p class="quote">
					I sailed through Turkish Customs by paying their special high fee
					for those who did not think ahead and get the visa already. I got
					the Petrie treatment from some astonished turks at the border who
					understood the sign, It was good fun. I watched as the Sun set in
					my mirror as I headed into the outskirts of Istanbul. <a
						name="Samson7"> </a>
				<p class="quote">Banditry along the road was so bad Station
					Masters freaked if you tried to sleep anywhere but under a bright
					light right in front of the attendant. I got some but not enough
					sleep.</p>
				<p class="quote">Doubt returned the next morning as I headed out
					of Istanbul and toward Ankara. The Confusion of the traffic signs
					passing by in Turkish alphabet with the occasional rare English
					word was mind boggling.... Driving on the right side of the road
					with the Left Side Steering of the British Tasty Treat van took it
					up a notch,... and in Turkish traffic, it was nothing short of a
					dangerous. "What were those Big Letters??? Was that for Ankara, as
					a scooter or two cut you off :)</p> <a name="Samson4"> </a>
				<p class="quote">
					I Got to Ankara and got the <a href=SamsonVisa.htm>Visa stamp</a>
					for Jordan first, then tried to deal with the Syrian Embassy. They
					really gave me the thrice over and this did not seem to bode well
					for this adventure. Perhaps I was pushing the Envelope a little far
					here. And These guys hadn't even spied Solomon on the Side :)
				</p>
				<a name="Samson8"> </a>
				<p class="quote">This thing could tax even my survival skills.</p>
				<p class="quote">Things were getting Tense. Time was short. The
					dig would start in a few days. It was fish or cut bait. I started
					to reexamine what I was doing. No Insurance, God what if I had an
					accident in Syria, or even here. Another Close call. I started a
					mini Panic attack. I was not getting enough sleep, tired, budget
					running short, crazy drivers, steering on the wrong side of the
					truck, signs in turkish... this could really get me screwed. If I
					had an accident then had to show insurance then... KaBLAM.... I
					misjudged the distance and ran smack into an 8 inch curb, blew the
					tire and god knows what else. It hit hard,... there had to be
					damage. The nightmare had suddenly arrived. "Time to keep you head
					about yourself" I told myself as the tasty treat van rolled into
					some big oval driveway. The tire off and the metal scraping and
					rolling along. "I am so screwed"</p>
				<p class="quote">Smiling faces began to appear everywhere. People
					saying "Hi", Introducing themselves, Shaking hands, ...broken
					English. "Oh Thank You Thank you so much". ...Yes, I had a spare.
					Oh boy, If I can get this done and on my way maybe... but then the
					lugs won't move. More smiles. Everyone takes a turn. Someone goes
					for a long metal extender bar, as these guys who are rescuing me
					inform me that they are the Ankara traffic police.. and "don't
					worry we will get you on your way". The large Oval Driveway was the
					Grand Entrance of the Ankara Traffic Police Headquarters.</p>
				<p class="quote">We extend the lug cross bar with the Metal Bar
					and two guys stand and jump on it while two others try to lift the
					other side. Nothing. Repeated on every bolt and nothing. I step
					back with a Grimace as the cross seems to bend like its going to
					snap.</p> <a name="Samson9"> </a>
				<p class="quote" style="margin-bottom:0">They look worried and drop a little oil on the
					lugs.</p>

		A small man walks from the building and a cry goes up as he is
		recognized. Everyone is sounding releaved. Crisis over. Oh Yea Yea,,,
		"<I>Just watch this"</I> they say.
	</p>

	<p class="quote">He reaches down with the cross bar and quickly and
		effortlessly snaps each bolt in turn. One Two Three,... four five six.
		In seconds all the bolts are loosened and he starts to take them off
		with his bare hands. Rapidly, using both hands at once.</p>
	<a name="Samson10"> </a>
	<p class="quote">Look at him. Click the photo and see the size of the
		Man. Yet every officer there knew the moment he walked out the door
		that the lugs were coming off !</p>
	<p class="quote">In the End, Israeli regulations defeated my
		determination to see the sights of Jordanian archaeology, at least for
		now. I returned to Istanbul, left the Van in a Turkish Airport parking
		lot and flew the rest of the way. An Odyssey that had started in a
		British Pub, buying a drinking mates truck for 50 pounds, and getting
		Penny Mead to paint it.... was over.</p>
