		lightning strike on our house caused a large rolling ball of chain
		lightning to come down the staircase, and out the door. I stood
		directly in its path and the large ball of flame approached within a
		foot or two, circled around me, in a half circle arc, and then

		Friends included Cardinal Lemot and Solomon Jones and a nearby
		volunteer named Harvey from Hawaii.&nbsp; Authored extensive economic
		analysis document for the project for C.A.R.E. Belize. Project was
		canceled in 7th month due to extensive drought resulting in a transfer
		through Washington DC to Peace Corps Thailand. Arrived in-Country
		1975. Trained in Lompoc assigned to Chang Rai agricultural assistance

		Corvalier, formerly of the Chilean Refugee Evacuation. During clerical
		work at the Nong Kai office I worked next to a former AID Cambodia
		director. I was intensely proud years later to see my former boss
		Lionel Rosenblatt on CNN playing Paul Revere in the Hutu Tuzi massacre
		in Rwanda, telling the authorities in no uncertain terms to get with
		it and get with it now.
	</p>
	<p>Left Thailand in 1976 working my way overland to Paris, France
		through Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey,
		Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia arriving in Barcelona Spain Christmas 1977.
		Moved to Munich Germany and began working as a Driver for Iranian and
		Lebanese entrepreneurs taking caravans of cars from Munich overland to
		Teheran and on one occasion Beirut (Ton and a half truck for the
		Syrian army). Trips were arranged on an ad hoc basis in among patrons
		of the Munich Hauptbanhof coffee shop. Extensively traveled the back
		roads of Greece and the alleys of Istanbul during this period with a
		crazy New Zealand Chess Champion.&nbsp; In Munich closely associated
		with a conscientious objector group of leftist students who worked out
		their service in the Munich International Youth Hostel, administer at
		the time by Heir Meilinger. Dieter(?) Reinhart and a Lady named Gail
		from Canada were my friends at this time. He was a Jazz Pianist from a
		rich family from Garmish outside Munich, she was from Montreal.</p>
	<p>Returned to Meadville in 1978 Attending Allegheny college to
		complete coursework for BA left undone to my extensive involvement in
		the student activities, the student movement and the anti-war effort.
		It seemed like a foreign country. Resided 815 Randolph 2nd. Things
		didn't go well, told John Hellerstadt about Cambodia a year ahead of
		Killing fields movie and he never forgot it.</p>
	<p>
		Left Allegheny College in 1978 hitch hiking to Bozeman Montana through
		Chicago in the second week of June... via the <a
			href="ElevenRegrets.htm">southern arterial</a>&nbsp; to join my
		family in a small business endeavor running an auction house in
		Bozeman Montana from 1978-80. Trained as an auctioneer at Kansas City
		Auctioneers school.. Prides Gallatin Valley Auction House was located
		on frontage road, Bozeman Mt. Family business did auctions for a
		number of estates in Bozeman. Employees included Gary France,&nbsp;
		Ellen Woodbury, othrs. Wrote hundreds of pickup slips for estates
		etc&nbsp; Rented an office in the Bozeman Hotel, began researching and
		designing computerized goods marketing system ala an early e-bay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moved to Billings Montana in 1980 to raise a private placement stock
		offering for a computer company through <a href="QT/0003.htm">DA
			Davidson</a> Inc. of Great Falls resulting in the formation of American
		Computer Network Inc. in Billings Mt in 1981 (capitalization
		$600,000). Served as Corporation President until the company failed on
		its third round of financing as a result of the Denver Penny stock
		market crash. Board members included Phil Boggio VP D.A. Davidson, <a
			href="QT/0004.htm">Charley McCartney</a> CPA, Dr. Mitchell Specter
		PHD MIT Computer science at age of 21, Dr. Bill Moore, chairman U of M
		Computer Science Dept,&nbsp; Bozeman. Moved in with employee Diane
		Auer and son John
	</p>
	<p>Moved to 554 1/2 Ward St, Queen Anne District, Seattle
		Washington&nbsp; in 1980, with Diane Auer/Dawson and her son John.
		Mother (Dawson) resided in Billings Johns father Dave Auer in
		Bellingham. Diane and John had been in the commodore messenger org
		group within Scientology for a dozen years. John was personal
		assistant to L. Ron Hubbard for a time. We both became active in
		Seattle Cult Deprogramming activities (me First) for a period of about
		a year. The hook of &quot;You can't exercise mind control on a maniac
		because the heart of mind control is the following of rules with a
		faulty base and a maniac is by definition unstable and incapable of
		permanent&nbsp; transformation of rule and thus a maniac&quot; was
		obvious to me if not to Ted. In other words, if you can be
		brainwashed...you are by almost mathematical definition
		&quot;sane&quot;.....ooops. :) His final &quot;Wait a minute I didn't
		bomb anyone statement&quot; came within&nbsp; months of that
		alt.fan.unabomber&nbsp; post (I wonder :)). I guess its all about
		communications in the end. Only one or two news outlets noted
		Kaczynski's'&nbsp; &quot;wait a minute I didn't bomb anybody
		statement&quot; in stories about the appeal.</p>
	<p>
		Relocated to San Francisco by motorcycle down the costal
		highway.&nbsp; Began working the venture startup specialists to
		finance the redesigned American Computer Network. While doing the
		round of venture capitol companies attempting a &quot;Reg D&quot;
		stock offering 4.0M, was involved in a <a href="QT.htm">motorcycle
			accident</a> resulting in broken jaw (4 places) and a 50% compression
		fracture of the lumbar one in San Francisco. Bad Timing, odd
		circumstances and strange coincidences. Treated at San Francisco
		general. Resulting lawsuit conducted through Kent Russell esq, San
		Francisco. Friend rendered assistance in the name of Charlie Daniels,
		New Age moving,&nbsp; while recouping in half body cast and full jaw
		wire. Records from the lawsuit were retrieved and searched by Russell
		and again by Mail Boxes etc Polson Mt.&nbsp;prior to my gaining
		custody of the records. Weirdly, every handwritten witness statement
		was there in the records, except the handwritten statement describing
		my injuries which I remember writing. This situation seems to be
		recurring in other attempts to retrieve handwriting samples.
	</p>
	<p>Moved to Maine to convalesce with family members living in
		Raymond Maine on little Sebago lake. Family is originally from
		&quot;Prides Corner&quot; Me . Dr Painter was the legal physician for
		the suit.</p>
	<p>Moved to Boston, working as a cab driver nights for the Town
		Taxi cab company serving Back Bay, Dorchester and Roxbury for six
		months. Started a new career in Real Estate working in the Real Estate
		rental markets in Brighton, Cambridge and Brookline for Wilkinson Real
		Estate. Passed the Real Estate Brokers exam and started Pride Realty
		of Boston specializing in computer screening and placement of homeless
		and welfare housing certificates in the Section-8 program. The
		pioneering software dominated the housing markets in Dorchester and
		Roxbury for several years and became politically controversial. The
		generation of external&nbsp; recordkeeping done by the database
		exposed patterns of irregularity in government housing funds and when
		examined by the Boston Herald resulted in the &quot;Boston Welfare
		Motel housing scandal&quot; of 1988 in which officials of both the
		Metropolitan Housing Authority and the Boston Housing Authority went
		to Federal Prison. The incident was regarded as a major embarrassment
		to Dukakis. It was estimated that 1/3 or more of the 6.0M homeless
		housing funds were being skimmed by Mafia Motel owners and corrupt
		local housing officials. Pride Realty of Boston worked closely with
		the local NAACP and local ministers and placed hundreds of federal
		section 8 leases for truly deserving homeless and low income families.
		Lease copies would be a treasured document by some beneficiaries. It
		was featured in a two page spread in the Boston Phoenix Newspaper in
		late Nov of 1988. The company was run by myself and Alison Hammond
		formerly of E 57th st in NYC. Leases after 1987 were computer
		generated after I got the form programmed into the database. Early
		attempts to stimulate the Phoenix author, Sean Flynn, to pursue the
		handwriting on the leases appears to have been unsuccessful. Landlords
		involved included Jeff Roche, Jane Miller esq., Colm Meany, Kevin
		Ryan, and many others active in Dorchester Roxbury Real Estate in the
		late 1980's. Ill advisedly purchased Real Estate in Roxbury from Ryan
		at Great loss. Primary entertainment in this period centered around
		Bunratty's bar on Harvard Ave in Brighton, Friends in this period
		included Gypsy Blanchette,&nbsp; local&nbsp; figure John
		Messina,&nbsp;&nbsp;A J Wachtel of Beat Magazine, currently still
		(2001) of the Boston Literary scene.</p>
	<p>The success of the Computer realty concept was ultimately based
		on the excessive damage factors included in section-8 leases which
		could be highly profitable when filled with universally good, but poor
		minority tenants often with strong church affiliations and good but
		limited credit. Pride Realty provided a link between the Real Estate
		Development community and the Black Community Leadership to
		dramatically expand available housing stock in Roxbury. As the scandal
		peaked in the headlines, the Boston Housing Authority emergency
		canceled its outstanding unsigned leases and all certificates. In the
		three years they had gone from returning 80% of the lease slots as
		unused to being oversubscribed. No more leases. The dominance of the
		computer selection system in low income housing in inner city Boston
		in 1988, and the impossibility of chronic problem tenants getting into
		housing, created a backlash among certain gang entities which can best
		be summarized by quoting one call precisely &quot;yo gonna get my mama
		an patment o I gonna come up dere (1353 Beacon st #2, Brookline Mass)
		em kick yo ass&quot;. One part of reorienting the balance of power in
		the community vis-a-vie housing stock. When included with the obvious
		anger of the Patriaca Crime family at the loss of over 2 million in
		now dilapidated Motel Revenues (Thanks John), a change of milieu
		seemed like a good idea.</p>
	<p>Relocated to New York City joining Allison Hammond and started
		database consulting out of ads in the New York Times.</p>
	<p>
		* When I wrote the Nathan R note I was leaning over a desk reaching
		out to write on an envelope which resided upon the VanPac bomb box
		copy (I still wonder what was in it). The pen did not work so I could
		not see what I wrote. When you can't see what your writing you return
		to the writing of your earliest days (Try writing without looking and
		you will see what I mean). <u><b>Therefore the earlier the
				writing the closer the match. </b></u>

		Last Wishes - that everything I own and all data pertaining to me be

		with fingerprints in my possession be donated to the Allegheny
		Pelletier library<br>with a special request that one of the
		Bathroom urinals be named "the Helmreich".

	*Date Coincidences just keep getting more and more and more interesting
	and wild. I am wondering if the lightning could have a time
	relationship with Yadins discovery of the Gate at Hazor in 1955 or
	1956. Just a wild guess, no idea how to see if such a relationship even
	could have existed. But the event was so extraordinary, after years of
	this stuff, just kind of makes me wonder.
