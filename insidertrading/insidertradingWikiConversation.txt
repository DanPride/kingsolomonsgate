[18:15] <k> the nick list on here is purposely obscured
[18:16] <memefilter> it varies

[18:16] <grey> Thank you.
[18:17] <m> 1.4 GB?? what's it about?
[18:18] <frero> unknown.
[18:18] <k> this is sort of funny that we've got something in the topic and no one knows what it is
[18:18] <grey> It's an unknown, encrypted file. Apparently the key will be given in an emergency.
[18:18] <grey> Hah. That's true.
[18:18] <frero> @grey: That's exactly what I think ;)
[18:19] <m> errmm..

[18:19] <Odin> Slightly, yes.
[18:20] <Odin> frero: It is insurance, in case anything untowards happens.
[18:20] <frero> ok
[18:20] <grey> Hello Odin.

[18:22] <Guest71053> Its a play
[18:22] <Odin> I'm sorry; no details on the contents will be given. That's best for all parties involved.
