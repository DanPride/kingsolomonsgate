						Jericho had fallen from grace, the dream of Biblical Archaeologist
						William Foxwell Albright was still just a theory. That summer <a

						The Solomonic Gate and wall complex at Tel Gezer was the third
						Solomonic Gate discovered. Scientifically, combined with the
						discoveries of the Megiddo Gate in the 1930's and the Hazor Gate
						in the 1950's, the discovery of the city gate of Gezer completed
						the scientific proof of Solomon's reign with rocks on the ground.
						It validated the historical basis of the Bible, Torah, and Quran <b>and</b>
						confirmed the rationale for the state of Israel's existence. It
						naturally follows that if Solomon really built the three Gates,
						then he also built the "House of the Lord", <b>and</b> the
						identical structures indicate one team of master masons. It was
						the long sought after historical nexus where scientific theory
						finally validated one critical piece of History sitting at the
						hinge of western civilization. The Old Testament was indeed
						written contemporaneously with most of the events it describes and
						is a valid recording of the viewpoints of Iron Age Man (<a

						Yadin's diggers (along with <a
							href="http://www.telecomtally.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DES-Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Duane
							E Smith</a> who has his own stories to tell (<a
							href="http://www.telecomtally.com/blog/">Abnormal Interests
							Blog</a> / <a href="images/Gezer71Staff.pdf">Pictured</a>) laboring
						in 100+ degree heat, swinging a pick axe, digging for the truth...
						had Solomon really existed, or was it all fiction. The answer came
						when my pick axe struck the inside of the stone basin of the structure. It
						resonated with a thud that rang like a deep throated bell in a sound I will
						never forget and that all nearby both heard and dramatically
						reacted to. Salime* raised his fist and shouted Ya heee, 
						Duane exclaimed in an excited shout "That sounds like something !!",
                        &nbsp; <a href="http://www.archaeology.utoronto.ca/gezer-gates.html">"Doc Holliday" :)</a> and others
						immediately crowded around on the balks of the square for a look.
					<p>
					<p align="left">Unrecognized by me at the time, my life changed
						at that point.  A pervasive wildness where the
						improbable became commonplace took hold. Adventure seemed to be,
						and was, everywhere. Risk aversion disappeared. Life became
						defined by a long series of crazy risks, phenomenal circumstances and
						coincidences that spanned decades. Many of Life's events bewildered me, and
						particularly in my younger years, often thrilled. Thrills that in
						time were replaced by intense misgivings and foreboding as the meaning became
						clear. </p>

					<p align="left">
						It is a very long list of events, but still represents only a
						minority of what has occurred. The intertwining coincidental
						phenomena clearly defy probability, and as a result, challenge
						belief. The sum total reflects the text that provides its milieu
						in detail, from a televised revelations drama at the Election of
						Pope Benedict, to a violent encounter with John Paul's almost
						assassin disguised as a Money Changer in the courtyard of the
						church of Justinian. It includes incidents from a contemporary
						Holocaust of an entire people (Cambodia) and from their
						international exodus, replete with its own Moses figure (Jerry Daniels). Even the
						slaughter of the innocents makes an appearance, and as if to make
						the point fine, does so on Christmas Day as a witness in the murder of Jon Benet. 
						(I was the guy in the bus station.) The one point I really
						could have missed in all this, was the murder of my good friend <b><u>Able</u></b>
						Harris by co-<b><u><larger>Cain</larger></u></b> crazed James
						Wallace on Aug 1, 1987 in my presence. That very morning in front
						of six witnesses he had said to me "I'm Abel like in the Bible, I
						am my brothers keeper". That very night he was publicly murdered
						in front of 300 witnesses trying to protect others in a crowded
						Boston Night Club parable of Cain and Able. But there are also
						lighter interludes and occasional high humor, all of it
						accompanied by numerous,... obvious,... Biblical and Talmudic
						parallels and replays that inexplicably repeat and inter-relate
						throughout. In total these factual stories can only be called
						unusual on a Biblical Scale... especially in combination. The
						deeper you look, the more interesting, stranger, and <u>darker</u>, it gets.
